           <h1>PROJECT MANAGEMENT (CSC 424)</h1> 
      
        <br>
        <h4> INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p>
         
Projects have been around since ancient times. Noah building the ark, Leonardo da Vinci painting the Mona Lisa, Edward Gibbon writing The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Jonas Salk developing the polio vaccine — all projects. And, as you know, these were all masterful successes. 
Organizations perform work which generally could be classified into either operations or projects, although in some cases both of them may overlap. Both operations and projects share many characteristics in common like:
•	People perform both the activities.
•	Both are constrained by limited resources.
•	Both are planned, executed, and controlled.
However operations and projects differ primarily in its repeatability. Operations are ongoing and repetitive whereas projects are temporary and unique. A project is “a unique endeavour to produce a set of deliverables within clearly specified time, cost and quality constraints”. It can also be defined as a temporary undertaking performed to produce a unique product, service, or result. Projects are different from standard business operational activities as they:
•	Are unique in nature: They do not involve repetitive processes. Every project undertaken is different from the last, whereas operational activities often involve undertaking repetitive (identical) processes
•	Have a defined timescale: Projects have a clearly specified start and end date within which the deliverables must be produced to meet a specified customer requirement
•	Have an approved budget: Projects are allocated a level of financial           expenditure within which the deliverables must be produced to meet a           specified customer requirement
•	Have limited resources: At the start of a project an agreed amount of labour, equipment and materials is allocated to the project
•	Involve an element of risk: Projects entail a level of uncertainty and therefore carry business risk
•	Achieve beneficial change: The purpose of a project, typically, is to improve an organization through the implementation of business change.

For many organizations, projects are a means to respond to requests that cannot be addressed within the organization’s normal operational limits. Projects are undertaken at all levels of the organization. They may involve a single person or many thousands. Their duration ranges from a few weeks to a few years. Projects may involve a single unit of one organization or may cross-organizational boundaries. As projects are often implemented as a means of achieving an organization’s strategic plan they are critical for the organizations growth. Examples of projects could include:
•	Developing a new product or service.
•	Effecting a change in structure, staffing, or style of an organization.
•	Developing a new or modified information system.
•	Implementing a new business procedure or process.

Diversity of projects
Projects come in a wide assortment of shapes and sizes. For example, projects can
✓ Be large or small
• Installing a new subway system, which may cost more than ₦1 billion and take 10 to 15 years to complete, is a project.
• Preparing an ad hoc report of monthly sales figures, which may take you one day to complete, is also a project.
✓ Involve many people or just you
• Training all 10,000 of your organization’s staff in a new affirmative action
policy is a project.
• Rearranging the furniture and equipment in your office is also a project.
✓ Be defined by a legal contract or by an informal agreement
• A signed contract between you and a customer that requires you to build a house defines a project.
• An informal promise you make to install a new software package on your colleague’s computer also defines a project.
✓ Be business-related or personal
• Conducting your organization’s annual blood drive is a project.
• Having a dinner party for 15 people is also a project.
<br><br>
<b>Stages of a project</b><br>
Every project, whether large or small, passes through the following four stages of its life cycle:
•	Starting the project/project initiation: This stage involves generating, evaluating, and framing the business need for the project and the general approach to performing it and agreeing to prepare a detailed project plan. Outputs from this stage may include approval to proceed to the next stage, documentation of the need for the project and rough estimates of time and resources to perform it (often included in a project charter), and an initial list of people who may be interested in, involved with, or affected by the project.
•	Organizing and preparing/project planning: This stage involves developing a plan that specifies the desired results; the work to do; the time, the cost, and other resources required; and a plan for how to address key project risks. Outputs from this stage may include a project plan documenting the intended project results and the time, resources, and supporting processes to help create them.
•	Carrying out the work/project execution: This stage involves establishing the project team and the project support systems, performing the planned work, and monitoring and controlling performance to ensure adherence to the current plan. Outputs from this stage may include project results, project progress reports, and other communications.
•	Closing the project/project closure: This stage involves assessing the project results, obtaining customer approvals, transitioning project team members to new assignments, closing financial accounts, and conducting a post project evaluation. Outputs from this stage may include final, accepted and approved project results and recommendations and suggestions for applying lessons learned from this project to similar efforts in the future.

<b>Project Team</b><br>
A project team is a group of people working together in collaboration or cooperation towards a common goal. Some teams are co-¬located in the same geographic area; some span multiple organizations and virtual team-working is increasingly prevalent. In each case, the ability of the project professional to develop and lead teams is of vital importance. For teams to be effective it is important that team members are understood as individuals in terms of their capabilities, their preferences, their cultural norms and expectations as well as the social dynamics between team members. Leaders need to adapt their style and approach to the needs of the team and the work that needs to be accomplished, this is called situational leadership. Leadership is the ability to establish vision and direction, to influence and align others towards a common purpose, and to empower and inspire people to achieve success.



Team Management
Team management includes the processes required to make the most effective use of the people involved with the project. The project team includes the project manager and the project staff who have been assigned with the responsibility to work on the project. Managing a project team is quite different than managing other types of staff, the project team has a start and an end, in terms of duties assigned to the project. Team management is not only limited to hiring and reassigning staff after the end of the project, it involves careful planning to ensure that the project has the right people at the right time doing the right things. 

Despite the recent information and technology revolution in project management, people are still at the center of project management and they determine the success or failure of a project. The project team is involved in the definition of the project goals, which are instrumental in planning, organizing, directing, coordinating, and monitoring all project activities. The team is able to meet the project goals and objectives by the skilful use of interpersonal and organizational skills such as communication, delegation, decision-making, and negotiation. In the challenging environment of development projects, people can be viewed either as problems and constraints or as solutions and opportunities.


A Team, Not a Group
Due to the complex nature of project development, it requires a diverse mix of individuals who must be integrated into an effective project team, and this should not be confused with bringing together a group of individuals to work on the team. The difference between a group and a team is how their level of work dynamics has an impact on the overall project performance. Gathering a number of individuals together in a group is the easy part, but it requires the use of special skills, new attitudes, and a strong commitment to turning those individuals into an effective team. A team approach is a distinctive way of working that harness the collective skills, strengths and energy from all team members. Teamwork leads to synergy and improves everyone’s performance.

Team Management Process
The major processes involved in team management are:
•	Plan: Team identification, the process of identifying the skills and competencies required for carrying out the project activities and assign roles and responsibilities.
•	Do: Team building, organizing the team and building their capacity to perform on the project, provide coaching and mentoring.
•	Check: Evaluate team and individual performance, monitor skills, and motivation.
•	Adapt: Improve team performance, build skills and set new targets
 
                                    
The Team Input, Process and Output (IPO) can be explained as shown below:
Inputs: Inputs for the project team management include the following documents or sources of information:
•	WBS
•	Project Scope Statement
•	HR organization policies
•	Assessment of team skills
•	Performance reviews
Outputs: The project team will use the above information to develop four important documents for the project:
•	Staffing management plan
•	Resource responsibility matrix
•	Team evaluations
•	Development plans

Team Identification
The first step in the team-management process is to identify the skills necessary to perform each project activity. Identification of team members goes beyond the technical skills and includes other factors, such as the ability to integrate, cooperate and lead. This process generates an organizational chart for the project roles, responsibilities, and assignments, often shown in a matrix format called The Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM), which includes a management-staffing plan that will help acquire the human resources defined and required by the project.
•	Skills Identification
The project manager develops a list of the required skills utilizing a Skills Requirement Table that will capture all relevant information to help identify the best people for the project. The project should have a list of special skills needed. The next step is to enhance the skills list with the qualifications, experience in years, and technical competencies as the basic criteria to properly identify the skills needed by the project.
•	Organizational Chart
Once the skills have been identified, the project manager develops the first Project Organization Chart portraying the structure that the project will use to manage the project team. This chart helps identify the reporting relationship amongst the project team members. Depending on the size of the project, the chart includes different levels of reporting relationships, some are direct relationships between superior and subordinate, others are shared internally, and others externally.
•	Team Assignment Schedule
Once the project has identified the roles in the Organizational Chart, the next step is to determine how these resources will be utilized in the project. The Team Assignment Schedule (TAS) facilitates the identification of "who does when" by providing the project activities information showing when each activity is scheduled to occur and who is responsible for it.
•	Team Allocation Matrix
The Resource Allocation Matrix portrays the number of hours per week that all the staff is assigned to a project and the total work hours. From this information, the project manager can identify the resources that are working more than the required hours per week, as well as the underutilized resources
•	Job Descriptions
The key output of this task is the development of job descriptions for the new positions or open positions that cannot be filled with the organization’s resources. The job description usually follows the organization’s Human Resources (HR) guidelines and procedures. The project manager’s role is to work with the HR unit and develop Job Descriptions (JD) including the qualifications, experience, technical skills, soft skills, and any other relevant information needed to help identify and recruit the best candidates for the job.
•	Team Recruitment
The project manager must work with other units in the organization during the team-recruitment process in order to either secure the team resources from within or from outside the organization through the recruitment process. Project managers need to have good negotiation and influence skills to get the internal human resources assigned to the project.
•	Team Induction
The starting point for a project team member should be no different than the starting point for a new employee. Most organizations have induction programs for new employees, including an introduction to the organization’s operations, values, and mission. New members need to be introduced to all the team, they need a full briefing on the project, and even to spend some time and work with various people to understand the purpose of the project, only then will the new member feel committed and do a good job.
•	Responsibility Assignment Matrix
The Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) allocates work to the "responsible" individuals, on smaller projects a team member is assigned responsibility for various activities defined in the WBS, on large projects an activity may be assigned to a subteam or unit of the project structure.
•	RACI Chart
RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consult, and Inform. In addition to identifying who does what in the RAM, the RACI is an extension of this matrix used to ensure that responsibility and accountability is placed with the person who really can be accountable for specific work. Often, this results in accountabilities for actions being moved down to the most appropriate level.

<b>Team Building</b><br>
Team building is the process of transforming a group of people who have different interests, expertise, and backgrounds, into an effective and integrated work unit. Building a project team is essentially a process of change where the skills of the team and the goals of the project are merged, transforming the group into an effective team that's total outputs are greater than the individual contributions. Building a team is a process that needs to occur in all types of projects, and its complexity will vary depending on the size and nature of the project, this is one of the principal responsibilities of the project manager. In the process of changing a group of people into a team, the project manager plays an active role as change agent and uses behavioural skills to overcome resistance to change.
These are simple and practical steps to start building a project team:
•	Build Enthusiasm: Create a set of simple tasks that provide a challenge and set achievable goals encouraging the team to work together. Make sure that responsibility is delegated to the team and not to the individuals. The aspects of increased efficiency, productivity and collaboration need to be highlighted as input to establish the criteria for success. Achieving a simple goal can provide the team with enthusiasm and a better understanding of what is expected of them as a team.
•	Establish Clear Conduct Rules: Teams need rules of conduct to help them achieve their purpose and performance goals, these rules should be established as early as possible to let the team get used to them and allow some time for clarifications. Some rules include attendance, conduct during meetings, confidentiality with personal information, and respect to the team and each individual.
•	Keep Open Communication Channels: The project manager needs to maintain a practice to keep open channels of communication with the team and amongst the team, there is nothing that lowers the trust of a team more than the absence of open communication channels. The team should feel that all information regarding and affecting the team is open for the team to discuss.
•	Reward and Recognize Teamwork. Take advantage of the power of positive feedback, recognition, and reward. Be alert to opportunities to reward the new team behaviour. These actions send a good signal to the team as to what is recognized as teamwork.

Team Development
Team development is the training, development, and support that the project or the organization provides to team members to focus their work on the project objectives and ensure that the team has the competencies to be successful in the project. Team development focuses on increasing individual capabilities in order to expand and enhance the project’s capacity to achieve its goals. Building effective teams is a process of going through four stages of development:
•	Forming
•	Storming
•	Norming
•	Performing
These four stages describe the changes that a team goes through as it develops more maturity, abilities, and stronger relationships.
•	Forming: is the first stage of team development filled with a mix of anxiety, high expectations, and ambiguity as the new members do not yet have a clear definition of what work exactly the team will be assigned with. In this stage, there is high dependence on the project manager for guidance and direction. The individual roles and responsibilities are unclear and the level of trust is low, building awareness and providing orientation are dominant themes in this stage as members focus their efforts on defining goals and developing procedures to perform their tasks. 
•	Storming: occurs after the initial meetings and introductions to the project. The team moves into a storming or reaction phase when the project manager’s authority or ideas may be challenged as roles are clarified. This is a critical stage where many teams fail if the tensions or disagreements are not resolved; the project runs the risk of evolving into a team that is not cohesive, which creates bitterness and resentment.
•	Norming: is the third stage when the team members know each other better, they may be socializing together, and be able to ask each other for help and constructive criticism. The team is developing a strong commitment to the team’s goal, and they start to see their contribution towards it. In this stage, the project hierarchy is clearer, team members start assuming their roles and responsibilities, and most critical conflicts have been resolved.
•	Performing: the last stage of team development is characterized by a shared vision of the project goal and a common understanding of the roles and responsibilities of all team members. The team has a high level of mutual trust and provides care and support for each other, which increases the overall performance of the team.

 
                                            Figure 4: Team Development Cycle
Most project teams are able to go through all four stages of team development, the time taken to move from one stage to the next varies from team to team and is heavily influenced by the experience and maturity level of the team members, the skills of the project manager, and general conditions of the project environment.

Team Leadership
Leadership can be defined as the ability to influence the project team to help achieve the goals of the project. Leadership is a critical skill that a project manager must possess, and it is one that must be earned. A project manager is not a team supervisor, but a team leader. A supervisory role is a position of traditional authority based only on power and respect for the position. Every team needs a leader and the leader’s ability is reflected in how he or she is able to convert a group of people working together into a team committed to each other and to the project goals. The management style depends upon the prevailing circumstance. Project managers should exercise a mixture of management styles during the project’s lifecycle; project managers go the following common stages:
•	Directing: At the very start of the project the team needs a leadership style that helps manage the initial anxieties, tension, or confusion between the goals of the project and the role of the team and its responsibilities. During this time, the project manager’s style is geared towards providing a course of action, in some instances, use of authority to assign tasks and activities. The communication involved with this style is mainly downward, from the project manager to the team member.
•	Coaching: As the project team makes progress and their level of understanding progresses, the team feels more confident about their role and the objectives of the project. In this phase, the leadership style evolves to coaching. The project manager and the team start building stronger relationships based on mutual trust.
•	Participating: The leader can now use the trust relationship with the team and start delegating authority and responsibility; there is an increased participation of the team in management decisions. The team does not need directions, knows enough, and feels confident and motivated to do the work.
•	Delegating: in this stage the team is confident about their abilities and is trusted to carry out the work with minimal supervision, most work has been delegated and the team performs and self-adapts. The project manager monitors the performance of the team and assumes a full leadership role.

Team Communication
As the project teams develop their ability to perform, the project managers must be able to communicate effectively to ensure that the team receives a consistent and clear message. This is especially important during the initial stages of team development because unclear or conflicting messages can increase the confusion and slow down the development process of the team. Interpersonal communication has three forms: verbal, nonverbal, and
written.
•	Verbal communication: is used when there is a need to transmit information, instructions and explanations on a short notice. It is also useful in situations where there is a need for highly interactive verbal communication because it allows a timely exchange of information, rapid feedback, immediate synthesis of the message, and agreement on the message.
•	Nonverbal communication: is transmitting a message without using words. It includes the use of vocal tones gestures, facial expressions, and body language. Nonverbal communication influence the receiver's interpretation of a message and it can have a different effect from the original message. 
•	Written communication: includes project reports, project reviews, project plans, organizational standards, policies, procedures, formal letters, announcements, legal documents, and other forms of information that can be transmitted in written form to the project team.

Human Resource Management
Project managers usually do not have direct responsibility over the administrative aspects of the project human resources, such as payroll, benefits, compliance with local labour laws, and organizational rules and departments take most of the administrative responsibility aspects, while project managers deal with the performance aspects, however, project managers should be involved in the administrative decisions that involve the project team including the need to comply with required organizational policies, procedures, and local regulations. The evaluations focus on the individual contributions but do not evaluate the performance of the team, however, what projects need the most is a method to evaluate the performance of a team and not just the individual.

Team Performance
Performance evaluations provide the project manager with an opportunity to assess how the project team, and its individual members, has contributed to the project goals, evaluations are essential to developing a high-performance team. Since most of the project’s work consists of collaborative arrangements, successful team performance is critical to achieving project objectives and goals, therefore, appraisal of team performance should be integrated into team-based activities.

Team Performance Evaluation Plan
Performance evaluations are essential for the effective management and project team evaluation. Evaluations help develop teams, improve performance, and feed into the project planning process. Formal team performance evaluations should be conducted regularly to enable management and monitoring of standards, concurring expectations and
objectives, and the delegation of responsibilities and tasks. Team performance evaluations also establish training needs and are an important component of staff motivation, attitude, and behaviour development, all of which fosters positive communications and relationships in the team. There are four steps for creating a Team Performance Evaluation Plan:
1. Identify performance expectations.
2. Develop a standard evaluation form.
3. Develop feedback guidelines
4. Set an evaluation schedule.

Managing Conflict
Conflict is a basic element of human behaviour and it is inevitable in projects that involve interactions between people and groups. The goal of conflict management is to channel conflicts so that the result is positive rather than negative. The project manager and the project team should seek to resolve conflict as soon as possible. The first step in managing conflict is the ability to understand it and correctly diagnose it. There are three types of conflicts:
•	Structural conflicts: deal with power, priorities, objectives, resources and politics.
•	Technical Conflicts: are differences in technical approaches, opinions, methodologies, and procedures.
•	Personality Conflicts: arise mostly from behavioural, social and cultural differences.

Project managers can use different conflict resolution modes and apply them according to specific situations or circumstances. Below are five conflict resolution models that can aid a project manager:
•	Forcing: involves imposing a decision and makes use of the formal authority vested in the project manager. It is mostly used when time is of the essence, and resolving the issue is vital to the well-being of the project.
•	Avoiding: refers to the refusal to deal with the conflict, or ignoring conflict as much as possible. This approach can be useful sometimes when there is a need for additional time to gain better understanding of the conflict, or it is used as a way to avoid making a difficult decision in the hope that the cause of the conflict will just go away or take care of itself.
•	Accommodating: involves avoiding disagreement while emphasizing areas of mutual accord. This approach is appropriate to initiate a positive start and avoid any increase in the conflict. It tends to keep peace only in the short term, but it fails to provide a permanent long term solution to the underlying conflict.
•	Collaborating: is a technique that involves incorporating multiple ideas and viewpoints from people with different perspectives, it is used when a project situation is too important to be compromised or delayed. The parties involved work to find alternative solutions and the best solution is found in a way that would not have been generated by a single individual.
•	Compromising: is a method to find a balance by offering something in return. It involves using negotiations and searching for solutions that bring some degree of satisfaction to both parties involved in the conflict. With this approach, neither party wins but both get some degree of satisfaction out of the situation.

Managing Performance Problems
Every project team has a member whose performance does not meet expectations. Before running into conclusion and use punishment or warnings, the project manager first tries to discover the reasons for the low performance. There are five steps the project manager can use to help identify performance problems:
•	First step: Before trying to solve the problem, communicate the situation in a way that the team member understands.
•	Second step: Determine if poor performance is either caused by a lack of motivation (the person is not willing to do the task) or by a lack of ability (the person is not able to do the task).
•	Third step: if the cause is due to motivation, the project manager should approach the poor performing person how their actual work differs from what is expected. Consequences of poor performance should be explained in terms of how it affects the project, the team, team members individually, and the project’s final goals.
•	Fourth step: if the performance problem is caused by a lack of ability, then determine if the person cannot do the task due to lack of skills or knowledge. Ask for ideas as to how to improve the performance, the person is the best one to identify what is needed, it may range from additional training, coaching or mentoring to show how the task or activity needs to be done.
•	Fifth and last step: is to establish a plan that will define what needs to be done and by when to correct the poor performance and develop a follow-up time to meet and review.

Team Improvement
The results of the team evaluation will provide information on the areas in need of improvement, either as a team or as an individual. The project manager can develop a plan to focus on the areas of improvement and the people involved. One approach is to use a matrix where the team members are listed along with the critical improvement areas that the project needs from them. The Skills Matrix is a useful tool to identify the level of expertise of all team members and to identify whether the skills required by the project are
balanced enough. This tool can also be used to identify skills in short supply and skills that are missing or absent from the team.

Improving Effectiveness
Making the team increase its effectiveness is not an easy task, it requires patience, consistency, and a proactive approach. Following some additional recommendations to help improve the team effectiveness:
•	Set up priorities: place what is important first and separate the mundane and trivial apart. The team needs a constant reminder of the project goals to keep them on the right track, it is very easy for team members to get distracted by other less critical activities or spend too much time on areas that may be of their own personal interest or curiosity than on the urgent activities of the project.
•	Results-oriented: is about focusing on results and less on the tasks or activities, it is easy to spend time on a task and lose sight of the results expected from the project. By focusing on the results, the project team has a different perspective of the tasks at hand, and they focus on the activities that add value to the project.
•	Be proactive, not reactive: is about anticipating and planning for different situations and not responding to events, when probably it is too late, too expensive or difficult to act appropriately.
•	Emphatic listening: is about the ability of active listening, it helps understand and be understood. This is useful when working with beneficiaries, it allows the project team to understand the needs and expectations of the beneficiaries and other project stakeholders.
•	Achieve synergy: This occurs when the team produces more results than the sum of the individual efforts, it’s about collaboration and working in harmony towards a common goal.

Team Training
Training the project team comes in three modes: formal education provided by universities or institutions, customized training such as the one provided by consultants and facilitators, and on the job training.
•	Formal education provides a generic form of training good to introduce basic concepts, theories, and techniques, some education providers make use of case analysis to study real situations that students can use as a basis to apply the techniques learned in class. This type of training takes time and may not provide the depth of skills needed for a project.
•	Customized training is provided by consultants or experts in a field who train a group of people on specific- knowledge areas, the content may be generic or customized to the needs of the project, which makes it flexible and adaptable. This type of training takes less time and participants can apply the techniques learned on the project relatively faster than they would if they attended a formal education program.
•	On the job training This is the best method to learn, but it requires a coach or close supervision of the participants. One of the benefits is that newly learned skills are applied immediately on the project. This form of training requires a learning culture in the project team to constantly learn and adapt to new situations.
All these modes of training are valid, but some offer more advantages than others based on the needs and goals. 

Team Building Activities
Team Building Activities demonstrate different aspects of team behaviours and get team members to think about what is essential for high performing teams. They allow the team to recover from frustration and conflict. They also help sensitize the team members to behaviours that may contribute toward or obstruct group problem solving. Behaviour entails good communication, problem-solving skills, trust, taking advantage of knowing
the strengths and weaknesses of each team member, and understanding the stakeholders’ point of view. There are many team-building exercises, the most popular involve some kind of outdoor activities, and however, these tend to be difficult to translate into benefits at the workplace. It is better to have an integrated program that combines outdoor events with ongoing activities in the workplace, such as: 
•	Work-oriented discussions of the group's objectives, roles, processes, resources
•	Social events or joint coffee break times
•	Learning on topics relevant to everyone
•	Meetings, not only to discuss day-to-day work, but also to acknowledge past successes and make future plans
•	Communication sessions (structured or unstructured) to increase overall team knowledge by sharing expertise, experience, and individual experiences.

Motivation Theories
Project success is highly dependent upon the motivation and performance of project team members and other stakeholders. A highly motivated project team translates into better quality, higher productivity, satisfaction and high morale. On the other hand, lack of motivation leads to conflict, stress, poor quality, and low morale and productivity, which increases the risks to fail in meeting project objectives. There are four important motivation theories that project managers should know to understand the dynamics of human behaviour:
•	Hierarchy of needs (Abraham Maslow): states that a person’s behaviour is guided or motivated by a sequence of needs that range from physiological needs, safety needs, social needs, esteem, and self actualization.
•	Motivational and Hygiene Factors (Frederick Herzberg): this theory proposes that team members are influenced by factors that increase their motivation, which is primarily the result of the satisfaction factors, such as achievement, recognition, promotion, and growth. That includes factors such as salary, benefits, work time, supervision, work environment, status, job security, that increase dissatisfaction if they are absent or inadequate.
•	X-Y theory (Douglas McGregor): McGregor maintained that there are two fundamental approaches to managing people. Theory x (authoritarian management style). Assumes that the average person dislikes work and will avoid it if possible. Therefore, most people must be forced with the threat of punishment to work towards project objectives. In theory Y team members usually accept and often seek responsibility and commitment to objectives is a function of the rewards associated with their achievement.
•	Theory Z (William Ouichi): Places a large amount of freedom and trust with workers, and assumes that workers have a strong loyalty and interest in team-working and with the project. Theory Z also places more reliance on the attitude and responsibilities of the team members, whereas theory X-Y is mainly focused on management and motivation from the manager and the organization’s perspective. Theory Z management tends to promote stable employment, high productivity, and high employee morale and satisfaction, and seeks to promote collective responsibility decision-making, self-evaluation and promotion.

Continuous Improvement
Building a team requires a constant review of the skills available and the skills needed by the project. As the project makes changes and even as people change in the team, the skills matrix changes and needs to be updated constantly. The project should document lessons learned that have provided good results in building the team capabilities and how the project was able to deal with difficult conflict situations.

What Is Project Management?
Project management is the process of guiding a project from its beginning through its performance to its closure. Project management is also the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities in order to meet project requirements. Project Management comprises:
•	A set of skills- Specialist knowledge, skills and experience are required to   reduce the level of risk within a project and thereby enhance its likelihood of    success
•	A suite of tools- Various types of tools are used by project managers to improve their chances of success. Examples include document templates, registers, planning software, modeling software, audit checklists and review forms
•	A series of processes- Various management techniques and processes are   required to monitor and control time, cost, quality and scope on projects. 
Examples include time management, cost management, quality management,   change management, risk management and issue management.

Project Management Process
Project management includes five sets of processes which are: 
•	Initiating processes
•	Planning processes
•	Executing processes
•	Monitoring and controlling processes
•	Closing processes

Initiating processes
All projects begin with an idea. Perhaps your organization’s client identifies a need; or maybe your boss thinks of a new market to explore; or maybe you think of a way to refine your organization’s procurement process. Sometimes the initiating process is informal. For a small project, it may consist of just a discussion and a verbal agreement. In other instances, especially for larger projects, a project requires a formal review and decision by your boss and/or other members of your organization’s senior management team.
 
Planning processes
When you know what you hope to accomplish and you believe it’s possible, you need a detailed plan that describes how you and your team will make it happen. Include the following in your project-management plan:
•	An overview of the reasons for your project 
•	A detailed description of intended results 
•	A list of all constraints the project must 
•	A list of all assumptions related to the project 
•	A list of all required work 
•	A breakdown of the roles you and your team members will play 
•	A detailed project schedule 
•	Needs for personnel, funds, and nonpersonnel resources (such as equipment, facilities, and information) 
•	A description of how you plan to manage any significant risks and uncertainties
•	Plans for project communications 
•	Plans for ensuring project quality 
Always put your project plans in writing; doing so helps you clarify details and
reduces the chances that you will forget something. The success of your project depends on the clarity and accuracy of your plan and on whether people believe they can achieve it.

Executing processes
After you have developed your project-management plan and set your appropriate project baselines, it is time to get to work and start executing your plan. This is often the phase when management gets more engaged and excited to see things being produced.
Preparing
Preparing to begin the project work involves the following tasks:
•	Assigning people to all project roles: Confirm the individuals who will perform the project work, and negotiate agreements with them and their managers to assure they will be available to work on the project team.
•	Introducing team members to each other and to the project: Help people begin developing interpersonal relationships with each other. Help them appreciate the overall purpose of the project and how the different parts will interact and support each other.
•	Giving and explaining tasks to all team members: Describe to all team members what work they’re responsible for producing and how the team members will coordinate their efforts.
•	Defining how the team will perform its essential functions: Decide how the team will handle routine communications, make different project decisions, and resolve conflicts. Develop any procedures that may be required to guide performance of these functions.
•	Setting up necessary tracking systems: Decide which system(s) and accounts you will use to track schedules, work effort, and expenditures, and set them up.
•	Announcing the project to the organization: Let the project audiences know that your project exists, what it will produce, and when it will begin and end.
Performing
Finally, you have to perform the project work and the performing subgroup of the executing processes includes the following tasks:
•	Doing the tasks: Perform the work that’s in your plan.
•	Assuring quality: Continually confirm that work and results conform to       requirements and applicable standards and guidelines.
•	Managing the team: Assign tasks, review results, and resolve problems.
•	Developing the team: Provide needed training and mentoring to improve team members’ skills.
•	Sharing information: Distribute information to appropriate project       audiences.

Monitoring and Controlling processes
As the project progresses, you need to ensure that plans are being followed and desired results are being achieved. The monitoring and controlling processes include the following tasks:
•	Comparing performance with plans: Collect information on outcomes,       schedule achievements, and resource expenditures; identify deviations       from your plan; and develop corrective actions.
•	Fixing problems that arise: Change tasks, schedules, or resources to bring project performance back on track with the existing plan, or negotiate agreed-upon changes to the plan itself.
•	Keeping everyone informed: Tell project audiences about the team’s achievements, project problems, and necessary revisions to the established plan.

Closing processes
Finishing your assigned tasks is only part of bringing your project to a close. In addition, you must do the following:
•	Get your clients’ approvals of the final results.
•	Close all project accounts (if you have been charging time and money to special project accounts).
•	Help team members move on to their next assignments.
•	Hold a post-project evaluation with the project team to recognize project achievements and to discuss lessons you can apply to the next project. (At the very least, make informal notes about these lessons and how you’ll use them in the future.)

            
Figure 5: Project Management Process
As illustrated in the figure above, these five process groups help support the project through the four stages of its life cycle. Initiating processes support the work to be done when starting the project, and planning processes support the organizing and preparing stage. Executing processes guide the project tasks performed when carrying out the work, and closing processes are used to perform the tasks that bring the project to an end. The figure highlights how you may cycle back from executing processes to planning processes when you have to return to the organizing and preparing stage to modify existing plans to address problems you encounter or new information you acquire while carrying out the project work. Finally, monitoring and controlling processes are used in each of the four stages to help ensure that work is being performed according to plans.

Successfully performing these processes requires the following:
•	Information: Accurate, timely, and complete data for the planning, performance monitoring, and final assessment of the project
•	Communication: Clear, open, and timely sharing of information with appropriate individuals and groups throughout the project’s duration
•	Commitment: Team members’ personal promises to produce the agreed-upon results on time and within budget

Project Scheduling
The project schedule is the tool that communicates what work needs to be performed, which resources of the organization will perform the work and the timeframes in which that work needs to be performed. It refers to the process of laying out all the actual activities of the project in the time order in which they are to be performed, keeping in view of the logical sequence of the activities. The project schedule should reflect all of the work associated with delivering the project on time. Without a full and complete schedule, the project manager will be unable to communicate the complete effort, in terms of cost and resources, necessary to deliver the project.

Project Scheduling Terminologies
Some of the terms used in scheduling techniques are listed below:
(a) Activity
An activity is any identifiable task that has a beginning and an end. An activity is represented by a straight arrow with circle on both ends




The direction of the arrow indicates the direction of flow of project.

(b) Event 
An event (node) is the beginning or end of an activity. An event does not consume time, manpower or material resources. Event is represented by a circle with a number or letter inside it.




(c) Dependencies
Dependency is fundamental in project planning. Understanding dependencies is simply, if activity B can only begin when activity A is complete, then we have a dependency. 

(d) Predecessors
Predecessor is a task whose start or finish determines the start or finish of another task.

(e) Successor
Successor is a task that cannot start or finish until another task finishes or starts

Relationship among Activities
A project is a collection of various activities and the activities are interrelated among themselves. There are three possible relationships:
•	Concurrent Activities
Activities that can be carried out the same time are called concurrent activities. In the figure below, activities A and B are concurrent. 












•	Preceding Activity
For a given activity the activity that occurs immediately before it is called its preceding activity. Example is shown in figure below.             

 Activity ‘E’ is the preceding activity for activity ‘F’


 





•	Succeeding Activity.
For a given activity, the activity that follows immediately after it is its succeeding activity. In figure below, activity B is succeeding activity A.






•	Dummy Activity
A dummy activity is an imaginary activity included in a network since it is not a real activity. It is does not consume time, manpower or material resources. It is included in a network to maintain the network logic and to avoid ambiguity. A dummy activity is represented by a dotted arrow as shown in figure below.







The figures below are further explanation on Concurrent, Preceding, Succeeding and Dummy activities.










Activity E is a dummy activity, Activity D can only start after Activity C is completed. But for Activity B to start, both Activities A and C should be completed 

















Activities A and B can be performed concurrently but Activity C can start only after both Activities A and B are completed.












Activities B and C can be performed concurrently but both B and C can start only after activity A is completed.


Project Management Tools
Project management is a technique which has a wide variety of tools to assist in accomplishing tasks and executing responsibilities. There are both manual and automated tools in project management that help plan, monitor progress, identifying critical paths, and other tasks required for a project to run smoothly.. Some of the most widely used techniques are:
Network Diagrams, Project Evaluation and Review Technique, Critical Path Method, Gantt chart and Work Breakdown Structure/

1. Network Diagram
This is a graphical flow plan of the activities that must be accomplished in completing the project. It arranges the activities in logical sequence following the precedence – succeedence relationship between the activities. 

 



There are two popular Network Scheduling techniques. They are
•	Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT)
•	Critical Path Method
PERT/CPM are methods for controlling large well defined projects. Projects are divided into tasks and subtasks. The completion of an activity is called event. An activity is a task. In a network, activity is represented by an arrow while an event is represented by a node.  After the tasks have been defined in WBS the precedence must be established. That is for any activity to be performed, certain other activities must precede it. Event is the start and completion of activity. The longest time path through the network is called critical path. Any slip in critical path is reported so that management can apply more resource to keep the project on schedule.

Rules for drawing a network
•	All activities shall be represented by way of an arrow pointing towards the right. This means the flow of network will be from the left towards the right.
•	There shall not be any cross-crossing of arrows
•	The arrow of a network shall not form loops
•	There shall not be unnecessary dummy activities in the network. It shall be introduced only when it is absolutely necessary.

Creating a Network
A network is developed by starting with a list of activities and their immediate predecessors. Note that these activities are work packages from work Break down. Network of 20 or 30 activities could easily be constructed by drawing the obvious sub-networks first and then connecting them.


Example
Let’s consider a typical project divided into tasks and duration as follows
a)	Conduct interview                        7weeks
b)	Investigate other system               3weeks
c)	Analyze requirements                  2weeks
d)	Investigate package                      7weeks 
e)	Investigate Hardware                   4weeks
f)	Write Report                                 4weeks

Using the above information we draw a Network diagram with duration and critical path added showing dependency as well.















From the above diagram
•	the arrows are activities
•	Once the project starts two activities; conduct interviews and investigate other system proceeds in parallel.
•	The two activities (interview and investigate other system) in the second point above will be brought together before we can start the next three activities. (Analyze requirement, investigate package and investigate hardware).
We show the bringing together by using dummy activity (one with zero duration indicated by the dotted line. We can use more than one person on our project if we wish.
We can locate all the activities in the critical path.
The critical path is ABCEG.
2. Project Evaluation and Review Technique
The Project (or Program) Evaluation and Review Technique, commonly abbreviated as PERT, is a form of the Network Diagram project management tools we just discussed. PERT is also used for identifying the critical path for the project. This technique was developed to simplify planning and scheduling large and complex projects and creating more realistic estimates of the duration of each activity. In a PERT network model, each activity is represented by a line (or arc), and each milestone (i.e. the completion of an activity) is represented by a node. A simple example is shown below:



 



Milestones are numbered so that the end node of an activity has a higher number than the start node. Incrementing the numbers by 10 allows for additional nodes to be inserted without modifying the numbering of the entire network. The activities are labelled alphabetically, and the expected time required for each activity is also indicated. The critical path is the pathway through the project network that takes the longest to complete, and will determine the overall time required to complete the project. Bear in mind that for a complex project with many activities and task dependencies, there can be more than one critical path through the network, and that the critical path can change. 
PERT planning involves the following steps: 
Step 1: Identify activities and milestones - the tasks required to complete the project, and the events that mark the beginning and end of each activity, are listed in a table.
Step 2: Determine the proper sequence of the activities - this step may be combined with step 1, if the order in which activities must be performed is relatively easy to determine.
Step 3: Construct a network diagram - using the results of steps 1 and 2, a network diagram is drawn which shows activities as arrowed lines, and milestones as circles. Software packages are available that can automatically produce a network diagram from tabular information.
Step 4: Estimate the time required for each activity - any consistent unit of time can be used, although days and weeks are a common.
Step 5: Determine the critical path - the critical path is determined by adding the activity times for each sequence and determining the longest path in the project. If the activity time for activities in other paths is significantly extended, the critical path may change. The amount of time that a non-critical path activity can be extended without delaying the project is referred to as its slack time.
Step 6: Update the PERT chart as the project progresses - as the project progresses, estimated times can be replaced with actual times.

While the standard Network Diagram uses one estimate for the duration of each activity, PERT involves three kinds of estimates for each activity. PERT incorporates uncertainty by making it possible to schedule a project while not knowing precise details and durations of all activities. The time shown for each project activity when creating the network diagram is the time that the task is expected to take based on a range of possibilities that can be defined as: 
•	The optimistic time (A): the minimum time required to complete a task- the situation where everything goes well; there should be little hope of finishing earlier
•	The pessimistic time (C): the maximum time required to complete a task- the situation where bad luck is encountered at every step.
•	The most likely time (B): an estimate of how long the task will actually take. It is the time that would occur most frequently if the activity could be repeated.
The expected time (the time that will appear on the network diagram) is defined as the average time the task would require if it were repeated a number of times over a period of time, and can be calculated using the following formula: 

Expected time = (optimistic time + (4 x most likely time) + pessimistic time) / 6 

OR 







Benefits
•	PERT is useful because it provides the following information: 
•	Expected project completion time; 
•	Probability of completion before a specified date; 
•	The critical path activities that directly impact the completion time; 
•	The activities that have slack time and that can be lend resources to critical path activities; 
•	Activity start and end date. 

            Disadvantages of the PERT
Despite all of the advantages already mentioned, there are some major downsides to this brilliant method of project planning. To begin with, 
•	the charts tend to be quite complex as the size of the project increases. In fact in certain situations it wouldn’t be uncommon to end up with thousands of activities and so many dependencies that someone brand new to project planning could become quickly confused and overwhelmed. 
•	On top of that, developing, maintaining and updating this chart can be expensive and difficult all at the same time. And sometimes the PERT chart can even extend to multiple pages with a number of sub tasks thus making it all the more complex. 
•	The next point against using this technique for project planning would be the prediction inaccuracies it can lead to at times. Unless someone with significant experience is planning the project.



















Examples – Case Study
In the following example, the Project manager knows the succession of the project activities and the optimistic, pessimistic and most likely time (in weeks) for the following activities:

3. Critical Path Method 
Critical Path Method, or CPM, is an important project planning tool used by project managers to monitor the progress of the project to ensure that the project is on schedule. The Critical Path for a project is the longest sequence of activities on the network diagram and is characterized by zero Slack for all activities on the sequence. This means that the smallest delay in any of the activities on the critical path will cause a delay in the overall timeline of the project. Any project with interdependent activities can apply this method of scheduling. Although both CPM and PERT employ networks and use the concept of critical path, the methods have two points of divergence namely:
1.	CPM is a deterministic approach: only one time estimate is used for each activity, and there is no statistical treatment of uncertainty variation in activity times can be included as planned variation instead of random variation as presumed in PERT.
2.	CPM include a mathematical procedure for estimating the trade-off between project duration and project cost.  
The essential technique for using CPM is to construct a model of the project that includes the following:
•	A list of all activities required to complete the project (also known as Work Breakdown Structure)
•	The time (duration) that each activity will take to completion
•	The dependencies between the activities.

Critical Path Method can perform the following:
(a)	Calculates
•	The longest path of planned activities to the end of the project
•	The earliest and latest that each activity can start and finish without
making the project longer
(b)	Determines 
           “Critical” activities (on the longest path)

The CPM Approach
Phase I
•	Break project into operations necessary for completion
•	Determine sequential relationship of operations
-Every operation must have event to mark commencement –i.e. completion of preceding operation
-Can operations overlap?

Phase II
•	Create time estimates for each operation
•	Determine earliest possible start date, earliest possible finish date , latest start and finish
-Determine “free float” and “total float”
•	Revised after completion of Phase III

Phase III
•	Establish time-cost relationship
•	Establish scheduling variations
-Determine most favorable balance between time-cost
•	Normal Start – normal time, least cost
•	All-Crash Start – least time, higher cost

Advantages of CPM 
•	It helps reduce project duration. 
•	 It helps reduce project costs. 
•	It helps improve project efficiency. 
•	 It helps define multiple and critical paths. 
•	It helps schedule, monitor and control projects.
•	 It helps in organizing large projects.
•	 It helps determine slack and float time. 
•	It reveals all the dependencies in the organization. 
Disadvantages of CPM 
•	Practically impossible to draw diagrams for large projects. 
•	Too much of confusion when dealing with a complex project. 
•	It does not account for resource allocation. 
•	It does not help in scheduling each personnel for each task. 
•	There is usually uncertainty in time determination for complex projects. 
•	It can sometimes, end up being complicated.

Calculating the Critical Path
In the figure below, there are six paths in the network. These are as follow, ABCFEG, ABCEG, ABCDEG, ACFEG, ACEG and ACDEG




























The duration for ABCFEG is 7+4+4=15
The duration for ABCEG is 7+7+4=18
The duration for ABCDEG is 7+2+4=13
The duration for ACFEG is 3+4+4=11
The duration for ACEG is 3+7+4=14
The duration for ACDEG =3+2+4 = 9
Therefore the path with the longest duration is ABCEG with 18 weeks. This is therefore the critical path.

Early Times
The two early times are Early Start Time (EST) and Early Finish Time (EFT). When scheduling activities you have to determine when at the earliest, the activities can be performed. These are represented on the network by early time for each activity namely early start and early finish. These are the earliest possible times an activity can be started and completed. The EST of an activity depends on the completion time of an activity’s immediate predecessors. It is found by summing the duration of each predecessor activity along the path leading to the activity in question. When more than one path leads to that activity, EST is the total time along the longest path.



Computing EST and EFT
Consider the network diagram in figure below, we will notice the following;

K	6













Suppose the EST for the first activity A, is 0 (meaning the project starts at a time 0). The early finish EFT of A must be 10 weeks. That being the case, activity B will have an EST of 10 weeks and an EFT of 16 weeks. Similarly, the EST for activities C, D and E will be 16 weeks. Before activity G can be started, all the immediate predecessors must be completed. The length of the part going through activity D is 
         16 + 4 =20
This is the EFT for activity D
The length of path going through activity C and F is 
     16 + 4 + 5 = 25
This is EFT for activity F. Therefore the EST for activity G is 25 weeks because that is the longer of the two paths leading to it and hence the earliest time by which both of G’s predecessors D and F will have been completed. The same happens at activity J. EST = 33 weeks is completed using the longest path at activity J, which is through activity H. EST = 33 represents the earliest time that both J’s immediate predecessors hence the earliest time that activity J can be started. Finally for activity K, EST = 41 weeks and EFT is 47 weeks. Notice that 47 weeks is the same as the expected duration of the project. From the above, EST’s and EFT’s are computed by taking a forward pass through the network. When an activity has only one immediate predecessor, its EST is simply the EFT’s of the predecessor. When an activity has several immediate predecessors, its EST is the latest EFT of all its immediate predecessors (that is the one with the highest value) when computed and hence the earliest time the new activity can be started.
The Early Start field therefore contains the earliest date that a task could precisely begin, based on start dates of predecessor and successor’s task and other constraints. Whereas the Early Finish field contains the earliest date that a task would possible finish based on early finish dates of the predecessor and successors tasks and other constraints and any leveling delay.

Late Times --- LFT and LST
When an activity is not on the critical path, it can be delayed without delaying the project. In any case, it is important to determine by how much this activity can be delayed. To do this we must determine the “Late Times” which is the latest allowable times that the activity can be started any finished without delaying the completion of the project. As in the other case of Early Times, every activity has a Late Start Time (LST) and Late Finish Time (LFT). Let us look at figure below which is similar to figure above; you will quickly notice that the method of calculating LST and LFT is simply the reverse of calculating EST and EFT.













To calculate LST and LFT 
Begin by assigning a target completion date to the terminal date which you can call TP. TP is selected to be same as the expected project duration. A long value can be used when the project does not have to be completed by the earliest time.
In figure 4.16 we start at activity K and make a “backward pass” through the network. If TP is 47 weeks, (LF at the terminal nudes is 47) then LST for activity K must be 
    47 – 6 = 41 weeks
Still moving backwards for activity J, the LFT must be 41 weeks and EFT must be    41 – 8 = 33 weeks
Continue to move backwards to complete LFT and LST when you encounter an activity that has multiple paths leading back to its LFT. That is the same as that it is the backward path with the smallest LST that provides the basis for an activity’s LFT for example there are three paths leading backward to activity B: 
For activity E, the LST is 47 – 6 – 8 – 5 = 28 
For activity D, the LST is   47 – 6 – 8 – 3 – 5 – 4 = 21 
Therefore for activity C, the LST is 47 – 6 – 8 – 3 – 5 – 5 – 4 = 16
Notice that the longest path backward gives the smallest LST, which is 16 weeks. Thus the LFT for activity J is 16 weeks this is the latest time J can be finished and have enough time to complete the longest sequences of remaining activities C – F – G – H – J – K by the target date of 47 weeks. 
Late start field therefore contains the latest date that a task can start without delaying the finish of the project. This date is based on the task’s start date as well as the late finish dates of predecessors and successor tasks and other constraints.
Late finish field contains the latest date that a task can finish without delaying the finish of the project. This date is based on the tasks late start and late finish dates of predecessor and successor tasks and other constraints. 
Other terms include Lag time, critical task, slack or float, free slack and total slack.

Lag time
This refers to a delay between tasks that have dependency.

Total Slack
The EST and LST for an activity are often not the same. The difference between LST and EST (or LFT and LST) is referred as the total slack time (or slack or the float) of an activity. It is the amount of possible variation between when an activity must take place at the latest and when it can take place at the earliest.
Total slack = LST - EST (or = LFT – EFT)

Free slack
The term free slack refers to the amount of time an activity can be delayed without affecting the start times of any successor activities. The free slack of an activity is the different between EFT for activity and the EST of its earliest successor.
Free slack = EST (earliest successor) – EFT

Float (slack)
This is the amount of time that a task can be delayed without causing a delay to:
	-subsequent tasks (free float)
 	-project completion date (total float)

Critical Activity
This refers to the activity with zero float.

Resource Leveling
This is the iterative process of assigning crews to activities in order to calculate their duration.

Difference Between PERT and CPM
Core Difference
o	CPM is used for projects that assume deterministic activity times; the times at which each activity will be carried out are known. PERT, on the other hand, allows for stochastic activity times; the times at which each activity will be carried out are uncertain or varied. Because of this core difference, CPM and PERT are used in different contexts.

PERT
o	PERT is used for projects in which activity times are unknown. For example, take a research and development project (RandD). In an RandD project, the amount of time to complete a given task is unpredictable. In such a case, PERT is the best choice, since it allows planners to allocate three estimates for completion times -- the most likely, the most optimistic and the most pessimistic.

CPM
o	The activities involved in a construction project, on the other hand, are much more predictable, and may not need three estimated completion times. If this is the case, CPM may be more appropriate, since unlike PERT, CPM also allows for planners to make trade-offs between the cost of the project and the amount of time needed to complete it.

4. Bar Charts (Gantt chart)
Another widely used tool is the bar chart or the Gantt. It is the pictorial representation showing the various activities involved in a project. The chart has two co-ordinate axes, one axis represents the activities and the other axis represents the time required for completion of the individual activities. Bar charts provide a way of illustrating the sequence of activities in a project but do not show dependencies very easily. The figure below shows a bar chart with the following activities and duration in weeks.







Activity                                                 Duration
T1 --  Conduct Interview		             7
T2 -- Investigate other system	             3
T3 -- Analyze Return	             	  2
T4 -- Investigate Analysis	                        7
T5 -- Investigate H/W		     	  4
T6 -- Write Report			             4 














In the above diagram showing all the different activities (T1-T6) involved in a result computerization project, the activities are drawn in the form of bars. The time taken for the completion of each activity is represented by the length of the bar.










In the above diagram, the different activities involved in a given project are drawn in the form of bars. The time taken for the completion of each activity is represented by the length of the bar.

Consider constructing a residential building. The following are some of the activities involved in the construction of the building

Activities	Time required
Clearing of site	2 weeks
Digging foundation	3 weeks
Raising foundation	2 weeks
Germany flooring	1 week
Construction to lintel level	3 weeks
Lintel and roofing level	2 weeks
Roofing	3 weeks
Ceiling	2 weeks
Plastering	2 weeks
Fixing doors and windows	2 weeks


The above activities can be represented in a bar chart. Note that there are some of the activities that can run the same time; such activities are called concurrent activities. There are some that cannot start except another activity has started and finished. This brings us to the issue of predecessors and successors.

Benefits 
They:
•	Help you to plan out the tasks that need to be completed
•	Give you a basis for scheduling when these tasks will be carried out
•	Allow you to plan the allocation of resources needed to complete the project, and
•	Help you to work out the critical path for a project where you must complete it by a particular date.
When a project is under way, Gantt Charts help you to monitor whether the project is on schedule. If it is not, it allows you to pinpoint the remedial action necessary to put it back on schedule.

5. Work Breakdown Structure
The fundamental concept of project management is the WBS. The basic idea is to take the overall work/project and to break it down protectively into smaller and smaller units until we end with individual tasks or work packages that we can estimate sensibly and assign to team members.
To develop a WBS, we start with 
•	A word description of the objective of the entire project.
•	Identify the major task required to achieve this objective
•	Prepare word description of the objectives of these tasks

Work Packages (WP)
The smallest element in the work breakdown structure is called work package. It may be at any level of Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). The work package establishes the degree of management visibility and control to be exercised in the project. It consist of an activity or sets of activities that  have common shop under each work package is assigned to a single manager to provide means of control of the entire project. The WP is of short duration relative to the entire project and has a definite start and completion date. A list in a typical WP consists of:
•	Project-id, title, number
•	Title and no of WP
•	Responsible organization manager
•	Interface events and dates
•	Start and end date for WP.
•	Naira and labour estimate/ weekly or monthly
•	Contract or funding source
•	A/C Charge no
•	Work order or shop order.


















         
Software Measurement and Metrics
Software Measurement: A measurement is manifestation of the size, quantity, amount or dimension of a particular attributes of a product or process. Software measurement is a titrate impute of a characteristic of a software product or the software process. It is an authority within software engineering. Software measurement process is defined and governed by ISO Standard.

Need of Software Measurement:
Software is measured to:
1. Create the quality of the current product or process.
2. Anticipate future qualities of the product or process.
3. Enhance the quality of a product or process.
4. Regulate the state of the project in relation to budget and schedule

Classification of Software Measurement:
There are 2 types of software measurement:
1. Direct Measurement:
In direct measurement the product, process or thing is measured directly using standard scale.
2. Indirect Measurement:
In indirect measurement the quantity or quality to be measured is measured using related parameter i.e. by use of reference.

Metrics:
A metrics is a measurement of the level that any impute belongs to a system product or process. There are 4 functions related to software metrics:
1. Planning
2. Organizing
3. Controlling
4. Improving

Characteristics of Software Metrics:
1. Quantitative:
Metrics must possess quantitative nature.It means metrics can be expressed in values.
2. Understandable:
Metric computation should be easily understood, the method of computing metric should be clearly defined.
3. Applicability:
Metrics should be applicable in the initial phases of development of the software.
4. Repeatable:
The metric values should be same when measured repeatedly and consistent in nature.
5. Economical:
Computation of metric should be economical.
6. Language Independent:
Metrics should not depend on any programming language.

Classification of Software Metrics:
There are 2 types of software metrics:
1. Product Metrics:
Product metrics are used to evaluate the state of the product, tracing risks and undercovering prospective problem areas. The ability of team to control quality is evaluated.
2. Process Metrics:
Process metrics pay particular attention on enhancing the long term process of the team or organisation.
3. Project Metrics:
Project matrix is describes the project characteristic and execution process.
•	Number of software developer
•	Staffing pattern over the life cycle of software
•	Cost and schedule
•	Productivity

Software Estimation Techniques
In order to achieve successful software project and proper execution of task, the Estimation Techniques plays vital role in software development life cycle. The technique which is used to calculate the time required to accomplish a particular task is called Estimation Techniques. To estimate a task different effective Software Estimation Techniques can be used to get the better estimation. 
Estimation is the process of finding an estimate, or approximation, which is a value that is usable for some purpose even if input data may be incomplete, uncertain, or unstable.” The Estimate is prediction or a rough idea to determine how much effort would take to complete a defined task. Here the effort could be time or cost. An estimate is a forecast or prediction and approximate of what it would Cost. A rough idea how long a task would take to complete. An estimate is especially an approximate computation of the probable cost of a piece of work.

The calculation of test estimation techniques is based on:
•	Past Data/Past experience
•	Available documents/Knowledge
•	Assumptions
•	Calculated risks

Few points need to be considered before estimating testing activities:
•	Check if all requirements are finalize or not.
•	If it not then how frequently they are going to be changed.
•	All responsibilities and dependencies are clear.
•	Check if required infrastructure is ready for testing or not.
•	Check if before estimating task is all assumptions and risks are documented.

There are different Software Testing Estimation Techniques which can be used for estimating a task.
1) Delphi Technique
2) Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
3) Three Point Estimation
4) Functional Point Method

1) Delphi Technique:
This is one of the widely used software testing estimation technique. In the Delphi Method is based on surveys and basically collects the information from participants who are experts. In this estimation technique each task is assigned to each team member and over multiple rounds surveys are conduct unless and until a final estimation of task is not finalized. In each round the thought about task are gathered and feedback is provided. By using this method, you can get quantitative and qualitative results. In overall techniques this technique gives good confidence in the estimation. This technique can be used with the combination of the other techniques.

2) Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):
A big project is made manageable by first breaking it down into individual components in a hierarchical structure, known as the Work breakdown structure, or the WBS. The WBS helps to project manager and the team to create the task scheduling, detailed cost estimation of the project. By using the WBS motions, the project manager and team will have a pretty good idea whether or not they’ve captured all the necessary tasks, based on the project requirements, which are going to need to happen to get the job done. In this technique the complex project is divided into smaller pieces. The modules are divided into smaller sub-modules. Each sub-modules are further divided into functionality. And each functionality can be divided into sub-functionalities. After breakdown of the work, all functionality should be reviewed to check whether each and every functionality is covered in the WBS. 
Work Breakdown Structure has four key benefits:
•	Work Breakdown Structure forces the team to create detailed steps:
In The WBS all steps required to build or deliver the service are divided into detailed task by Project manager, Team and customer. It helps to raise the critical issues early on, narrow down the scope of the project and create a dialogue which will help make clear, bring out assumptions, ambiguities, narrow the scope of the project, and raise critical issues early on.
•	Work Breakdown Structure help to improve the schedule and budget.
WBS enables you to make an effective schedule and good budget plans. As all tasks are
already available so it helps in generating a meaningful schedule and makes scheming a
reliable budget easier.
•	Work Breakdown Structure creates accountability
The level of details task breakdown helps to assign particular module task to individual, which makes easier to hold person accountable to complete the task. Also the detailed task in WBS, people cannot allow hiding under the “cover of broadness.”
•	Work Breakdown Structure creation breeds commitment
The process of developing and completing a WBS breed excitement and commitment. Although the project manager will often develop the high-level WBS, he will seek the participation of his core team to flesh out the extreme detail of the WBS. This participation will spark involvement in the project.

3) Three Point Estimation:
Three point estimation is the estimation method is based on statistical data. It is very much
similar to WBS technique, task are broken down into subtasks and three types of estimation are done on this sub pieces.
Optimistic Estimate (Best case scenario in which nothing goes wrong and all conditions are optimal.) = A
Most Likely Estimate (most likely duration and there may be some problem but most of the things will go right.) = M
Pessimistic Estimate (worst case scenario which everything goes wrong) = B

Formula to find Value for Estimate (E) = A + (4*M) + B / 6

Standard Deviation (SD) = = (B – A)/6

4) Functional Point Method:
Functional Point is measured from a functional, or user, point of view. It is independent of computer language, capability, technology or development methodology of the team. It is based on available documents like SRS, Design etc. In this FP technique we have to give weightage to each functional point. Prior to start actual estimating tasks functional points are divided into three groups like Complex, Medium and Simple. Based on similar projects and Organization standards we have to define estimate per function points.

Total Effort Estimate = Total Function Points * Estimate defined per Functional Point

Let us take a simple example to get clearer:






Table 4: Functional Point Method


 

Advantages of the Functional Point Method:
•	In pre-project stage the estimates can be prepared.
•	Based on requirement specification documents the method’s reliability is relatively high.
Disadvantages of Software Estimation Techniques:
•	Due to hidden factors can be over or under estimated
•	Not really accurate
•	It is based on thinking
•	Involved Risk
•	May give false result
•	Bare to losing
•	Sometimes cannot trust in estimate








Software Quality Assurance
Software quality assurance (SQA) is a process which assures that all software engineering processes, methods, activities and work items are monitored and comply against the defined standards. These defined standards could be one or a combination of any like ISO 9000, CMMI model, ISO15504, etc. SQA incorporates all software development processes starting from defining requirements to coding until release. Its prime goal is to ensure quality.

Software Quality Assurance Plan
As the name suggested Software quality assurance (SQAP), the software quality assurance plan comprises of the procedures, techniques, and tools that are employed to make sure that a product or service aligns with the requirements defined in the SRS (Software Requirement Specification).

 


The plan identifies the SQA responsibilities of a team, lists the areas that need to be reviewed and audited. It also identifies the SQA work products.
The SQA plan document consists of the below sections:
•	Purpose section
•	Reference section
•	Software configuration management section
•	Problem reporting and corrective action section
•	Tools, technologies and methodologies section
•	Code control section
•	Records: Collection, maintenance and retention section
•	Testing methodology
SQA Activities
Given below is the list of SQA activities:
1. Create a Management Plan
This section includes proper planning on how SQA will be implemented in your software product.
2. Checkpoint Setting
Before moving forward quality engineer has to set up the checkpoints at different section to ensure the quality of the product.
3. Applying software engineering Techniques
Software engineering techniques are the most important part to test your product. It leads to achieving high-quality product output which is necessary.
4. Executing Formal Technical Reviews:
FTR is basically done to get the quality and design of the product. In this phase meeting is held between a technical engineer and they will decide how to execute further.
5. Multi Testing Strategy
In testing field no one should depend on one testing technique, Product should be tested by multiple techniques so that we will get bug if present from all angles.
6. Change Controlling
In controlling change, we use a mix of manual methods and automated tools to have a strategy for change control.
7. Measuring Change Impact:
In this phase, if any bug or error is found then the testing team will report it to the developers so that they can fix it.
8. SQA Audits
Software quality assurance audit checks the entire actual SDLC process followed by comparing it against the established process. It also checks error reported by the team in the status reports were actually performed or not.
9. Records and Reports Maintenance
Maintaining data is very essential factor in every field so as in Testing too. The audit results, test results, change requests documentation, review reports should be kept for future reference.
10. Manage Good Relations:
Managing good relation between developer and tester is also a very important factor because they both think that they are superior to each other. In their fight quality of the product may suffer so it's important to maintain good relation.
11. Enforcing Process Adherence:
This activity insists the need for process adherence during the software development process. The development process should also stick to the defined procedures.




This activity is a blend of two sub-activities which are explained below in detail:
(i) Product Evaluation:
This activity confirms that the software product is meeting the requirements that were discovered in the project management plan. It ensures that the set standards for the project are followed correctly.
(ii) Process Monitoring:
This activity verifies if the correct steps were taken during software development. This is done by matching the actually taken steps against the documented steps.

Software Configuration Management
Software Configuration Management is a process to systematically manage, organize, and control the changes in the documents, codes, and other entities during the Software Development Life Cycle. It is abbreviated as the SCM process in software engineering. The primary goal is to increase productivity with minimal mistakes. The software configuration management process is considered by many IT personnel as the best solution for handling changes to software projects. The software configuration management process identifies the functional and physical attributes of software at critical points in time, and implements procedures to control changes to an identified attribute with the objective of maintaining software integrity and traceability throughout the software life cycle. The software configuration management process traces changes and verifies that the software has all of the planned changes that are supposed to be included in a new release.
The primary reasons for Implementing Software Configuration Management System are:
•	There are multiple people working on software which is continually updating
•	It may be a case where multiple version, branches, authors are involved in a software project, and the team is geographically distributed and works concurrently
•	Changes in user requirement, policy, budget, schedule need to be accommodated.
•	Software should able to run on various machines and Operating Systems
•	Helps to develop coordination among stakeholders
•	SCM process is also beneficial to control the costs involved in making changes to a system

    



Any change in the software configuration Items will affect the final product. Therefore, changes to configuration items need to be controlled and managed.

Tasks in SCM process
•	Configuration Identification
•	Baselines
•	Change Control
•	Configuration Status Accounting
•	Configuration Audits and Reviews

Configuration Identification:
Configuration identification is a method of determining the scope of the software system. With the help of this step, you can manage or control something even if you don't know what it is. It is a description that contains the CSCI type (Computer Software Configuration Item), a project identifier and version information.

Activities during this process:
•	Identification of configuration Items like source code modules, test case, and requirements specification.
•	Identification of each CSCI in the SCM repository, by using an object-oriented approach
•	The process starts with basic objects which are grouped into aggregate objects. Details of what, why, when and by whom changes in the test are made
•	Every object has its own features that identify its name that is explicit to all other objects
•	List of resources required such as the document, the file, tools, etc.
Example:
Instead of naming a File login.php its should be named login_v1.2.php where v1.2 stands for the version number of the file Instead of naming folder "Code" it should be named "Code_D" where D represents code should be backed up daily.

Baseline:
A baseline is a formally accepted version of a software configuration item. It is designated and fixed at a specific time while conducting the SCM process. It can only be changed through formal change control procedures.

Activities during this process:
•	Facilitate construction of various versions of an application
•	Defining and determining mechanisms for managing various versions of these work products
•	The functional baseline corresponds to the reviewed system requirements
•	Widely used baselines include functional, developmental, and product baselines

In simple words, baseline means ready for release.

Change Control:
Change control is a procedural method which ensures quality and consistency when changes are made in the configuration object. In this step, the change request is submitted to software configuration manager.

Activities during this process:
•	Control ad-hoc change to build stable software development environment. Changes are committed to the repository
•	The request will be checked based on the technical merit, possible side effects and overall impact on other configuration objects.
•	It manages changes and making configuration items available during the software lifecycle

Configuration Status Accounting:
Configuration status accounting tracks each release during the SCM process. This stage involves tracking what each version has and the changes that lead to this version.

Activities during this process:
•	Keeps a record of all the changes made to the previous baseline to reach a new baseline
•	Identify all items to define the software configuration
•	Monitor status of change requests
•	Complete listing of all changes since the last baseline
•	Allows tracking of progress to next baseline
•	Allows to check previous releases/versions to be extracted for testing

Configuration Audits and Reviews:
Software Configuration audits verify that the entire software product satisfies the baseline needs. It ensures that what is built is what is delivered.

Activities during this process:
•	Configuration auditing is conducted by auditors by checking that defined processes are being followed and ensuring that the SCM goals are satisfied.
•	To verify compliance with configuration control standards. auditing and reporting the changes made
•	SCM audits also ensure that traceability is maintained during the process.
•	Ensures that changes made to a baseline comply with the configuration status reports
•	Validation of completeness and consistency


Participant of SCM process:
Following are the key participants in SCM


 



1. Configuration Manager
•	Configuration Manager is the head who is Responsible for identifying configuration items.
•	CM ensures team follows the SCM process He/She needs to approve or reject change requests
2. Developer
•	The developer needs to change the code as per standard development activities or change requests. He is responsible for maintaining configuration of code. 
•	The developer should check the changes and resolves conflicts
3. Auditor
•	The auditor is responsible for SCM audits and reviews. 
•	Need to ensure the consistency and completeness of release.
4. Project Manager:
•	Ensure that the product is developed within a certain time frame 
•	Monitors the progress of development and recognizes issues in the SCM process
•	Generate reports about the status of the software system 
•	Make sure that processes and policies are followed for creating, changing, and testing
5. User
The end user should understand the key SCM terms to ensure he has the latest version of the software

Software Configuration Management Plan
The SCMP (Software Configuration management planning) process planning begins at the early phases of a project. The outcome of the planning phase is the SCM plan which might be stretched or revised during the project. 
•	The SCMP can follow a public standard like the IEEE 828 or organization specific standard
•	It defines the types of documents to be management and a document naming. Example Test_v1
•	SCMP defines the person who will be responsible for the entire SCM process and creation of baselines.
•	Fix policies for version management and change control
•	Define tools which can be used during the SCM process
•	Configuration management database for recording configuration information.






Software Configuration Management Tools
Any Change management software should have the following 3 Key features:

Concurrency Management:
When two or more tasks are happening at the same time, it is known as concurrent operation. Concurrency in context to SCM means that the same file being edited by multiple persons at the same time. If concurrency is not managed correctly with SCM tools, then it may create many pressing issues.

Version Control:
SCM uses archiving method or saves every change made to file. With the help of archiving or save feature, it is possible to roll back to the previous version in case of issues.

Synchronization:
Users can checkout more than one files or an entire copy of the repository. The user then works on the needed file and checks in the changes back to the repository. They can synchronize their local copy to stay updated with the changes made by other team members.

Risk Analysis
In project management, a risk is defined as a situation or an event that can negatively impact the success of your project. Several kinds of risk can be identified:
•	External stakeholders-related risks: customers, consumers, suppliers…
•	Internal risks: project team members, top-management…
•	Project-related risks: technological or logistic risks…
•	Event-related risks: economic (e.g. financial crisis), sociopolitical (e.g. embargo…)

In project management, risk analysis is a proactive method to forecast negative events (risks) that could occur in a project in order to be better prepared or to reduce their likelihood. It is also defined as the sequence of processes of risk management planning, analysis of risks, identification and controlling risk on a project. Risk analysis is intended to be used regularly during the whole project lifecycle. The first step implies identifying global risks of the project and relative management strategies to avoid them. 

The Risk Analysis Process in Project Management
The risk analysis process is what follows the Identification of Risks procedure and is distinguished by two clear categories: Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Analysis.

Qualitative Risk Analysis is the process during which one prioritizes risks for further
action by assessing their probability of impacting project development.
•	Risk probability and impact assessment: During this stage every particular risk that might occur is investigated and analyzed in relation to its plausible effects, both positive opportunities and negative threats, on the project’s objectives (e.g. cost, schedule, quality, performance). Each risk is defined in levels my means of an interview, an investigation or a meeting with all related stakeholders to document the identified results.
•	Impact risk rating matrix: The documented results of risk probability can be described in qualitative terms, such as very high, high, neutral, low and very low. The risk rating is developed using a matrix which represents risk scales for each of the risks. The matrix documents the risk probability scale between no possibility (0.0 rate) and certainty (1.0 rate), as well as the risk’s impact scale, reflecting the severity of its influence on the project’s objective. This matrix helps to improve the quality of the data and make the process easier to replicate several times during the project. 
•	Risk categorization: In this step, risks are grouped by common causes to determine the most exposed areas of the project and to help develop an effective risk response plan.
•	Risk urgency assessment: In some cases, the risk of urgency can be combined with the risk ranking, a method used to evaluate the degree to which data about risks is useful for risk management, generating a final sensitivity rating.
•	Expert judgement: On many occasions it can be helpful to take advice from experts, such as individuals with recent experience on similar project cases, through interviews or risk facilitation workshops.

Quantitative Risk Analysis Process aims to numerically analyze the possibility of every
risk and its effect on project objectives, as well as the degree of overall project risk. This procedure uses several techniques and methods such as data collection and representational techniques to determine the probability of achieving project objectives, to quantify the exposure to risks and develop a size and cost assessment schedule.
•	Interviewing stakeholders: To this end, one might carry out interviews to gather information and form optimistic (low rating) and pessimistic (high rating) risk scenarios.
•	Sensitivity analysis: Helps to de􀁺ne which risks have the most potential effect on the project. Generally, this analysis investigates the extent to which the uncertainty of each of the project’s elements influences the examination of the objective when other unclear elements are held at their baseline values and can be represented via a tornado diagram.
•	Expected monetary values analysis (EMV): Is a statistical method that measures the average outcome when the future includes scenarios that may or may not occur (such as positive values-opportunities, or negative values-risks). These are usually depicted by a Decision Tree Analysis, which is a diagram describing a decision under consideration and the implications of choosing from the available alternatives. This diagram, includes probabilities of risks and the subsequent cost or gain of each logical path.
•	Modeling and simulation: Is a tool that uses a model that converts the uncertainties into their potential impact on project objectives, generalized to the level of the total project. To help with this, one might use the Monte Carlo technique.
•	Cost risk analysis: For cost estimation analysis traditional project WBS can be used, otherwise, cost estimates can be used as input values, chosen for each iteration incidentally, according to the values probability distribution, in order to define the total cost.
•	Schedule risk analysis: The Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM) can be used for schedule risk analysis. It is a method of constructing a project network diagram that represents the activities and their connection with arrows to show dependencies. One can use this activity-on-node diagram to check whether the project objective will be completed by a certain date and within the cost estimation.
•	Expert judgment: Obtaining advice from experts to identify potential cost and schedule effects, evaluate possibilities, interpret data and identify weaknesses and strengths can be of great value.

Risks constitute a common reality on all projects. One of the biggest challenges a project
manager has to face is to not become overwhelmed by the number or magnitude of possible identified risks. Instead, a good project manager should have the ability to focus
on the important elements that could threaten the project’s smooth operation and subsequently develop a risk response plan. The risk analysis process in project management is one of the most important procedures in project management and it aims to minimize the liabilities of the project and ensure its path to successful completion.

Continuous Assessment for CSC 424-Project Management
400Level Computer Science 2nd Semester 2019/2020

Question 1
(a) Explain the two popular network scheduling techniques	(6 marks)
(b) Give the meaning of the following terms:
	 (i) Closed Loops	(1mk)
(ii) Dummy activities (1mk)	
(iii) Parallel activities (1mk)
 (iv) Preceding and Succeeding activities (2marks)
(v) Concurrent activities  (1mk)

Question 2
(a) Use the diagram below to calculate the estimated project completion time and      
      show the critical path. (Assume that the time is in weeks)	(8mks)



			





 (b) From the diagram, get both the Earliest and Latest time for events 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9
											(10mks)	



Question 3
(a)	Consider the table below and use it to generate a project network assuming that the time required for each activity is in weeks: (9mks)
Event	Immediately Preceding Event	Earliest Time
1	          --	0
2	          1	0 + 6 = 6
3	          1	0 + 3 = 3
4	          1	0 + 5 = 5
5	          2	6 + 4 = 10
6	          3,4	Max{ 3+7, 5+4} = 10
7	          4	5 + 6 =11
8	          2,5,6	Max{ 6+5, 10+3, 10+4} = 14
9	          6,7	Max{ 10+3, 11+2} = 13
10	          8,9	Max{ 14+6, 13+5} = 20

Question 4
(a)	Define Slack and Float time (6mks)
(b)	Carefully study the diagram below. Assume that the time required (in weeks) for each activity is a predictable constant and that it is given by the number along the corresponding branch. Find for each event the (i) Earliest time (ii) Latest time. Identify also the critical path. (15mks)
