           <h1>COMPUTER SYSTEM PERFORMANCE EVALUATION [CSC 425]</h1> 
      
        <br>
        <h4> INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p>
        Computer performance is the amount of work accomplished by a computer system. A computer performance evaluation is defined as the process by which a computer system's resources and outputs are assessed to determine whether the system is performing at an optimal level. It is similar to a voltmeter that a handyman may use to check the voltage across a circuit.
        <br><br>
        <b> Computer Performance Measurement Techniques</b><br>
         Depending on the context, high computer performance may involve one or more of the following:
            High throughput (rate of processing work). This is the amount of work accomplished  
                by a computer system per unit time.
            Short response time for a given piece of work
            Low utilization of computing resources
            High availability of the computing system or application
            Fast (or highly compact) data compression and decompression
            High bandwidth
            Short data transmission time

        The performance of any computer system can be evaluated in measurable, technical terms, using one or more of the metrics listed above. In a non-technical term, computer performance simply means ‘how well is the computer doing the work it is supposed to do’, according to Arnoid Allen.  


        <br><br>
       <b> Computer Performance Metrics</b><br>
        Metric is something by which we judge a system. This is what we observe, measure, evaluate. Parameter is what we change to see how it affects a metric. This difference in metrics and parameters is important to note in system evaluation. 


                                                    


        In Computer performance metrics, things to measure include:
        (1) Availability: Availability of a system is typically measured as a factor of its reliability, as reliability increases so do availability. Availability is the probability that the system will be functioning correctly at any given time. Availability is quantified by 
        1 - MTTR/MTTF    [ MTTR is Mean Time To Repair while MTTF is Mean Time To Failure]
        (2) Response time: This is the total amount of time it takes to response to a request for service (any unit of work ranging from a simple disk I/O to loading a complex web page). In real life, it can be compared to the time between placing an order to receiving a delivery.
        Response time is the sum of the three times below:
        (a) Service time – How long it takes to do the work requested.
        (b) Wait time- How long the request has to wait for requests queued ahead of it 
                            before it gets to run.
        (c) Transmission time – How long it takes to move the request to the computer 
                                            doing the work and the response back to the requestor. 
        (3) Reliability: This is the probability that a piece of equipment or component will perform its intended function satisfactorily for a prescribed time and under stipulated environmental conditions. Reliability is often quantified by MTTF- mean time to failure.
        (4) Channel capacity: This is the tightest upper bound on the rate of information, that 
            can be reliably transmitted over a communication channel. 
        (5) Throughput- The rate of production or the rate at which jobs can be processed. The computer's throughput is defined as the number of units of information that can be successfully processed at any given time. The throughput is commonly measured using bits per second (bps)—more specifically, megabits per second (Mbps) and gigabits per second (Gbps). For example, if the post office can receive and process a maximum of 1000 items per day, then that's its throughput.
        (6) Bandwidth:  In computing, bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path. Bandwidth may be characterized as network bandwidth, data bandwidth, or digital bandwidth. It’s a range of available or consumed data communication resources, expressed in bits per seconds or multiples of it (bit, kilobit, megabit, gigabit, etc)
        (7) Latency: This is the time delay between the cause and the effect of some physical change in the system being observed. It is a result of the limited velocity with which any physical interaction can take place.  Latency is the term used to describe the state of existence of something in transition. Every transmitted piece of information on a computer system travels over some sort of medium. Computer latency is defined as the time it takes to communicate a message, or the time the message spends traveling the geographical distance ('on the wire') before it gets to its desired destination. This can be compared to the time one spends on an aircraft, traveling from one geographical location to another.
        (8) Scalability:- The ability of a system, network or process to handle a growing amount of work in a capable manner or its ability to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. 
        (9) Power consumption:-The amount of electricity used by the Computer. This becomes especially important for systems with limited power sources such as solar, batteries, human power.
        (10) Compression ratio:- Compression helps to reduce resource usage such as data storage space or transmission capacity. Compressed data must be decompressed to use hence it is subject to a space-time complexity trade off.
        (11) Processing speed: Your computer contains a processor stored on a computer chip. The speed at which your laptop runs programs or completes tasks is determined in great measure by your computer processor speed. Processor speed is measured in gigahertz (GHz); the higher the measurement, the faster the processor. The term speed is usually in reference to the clock speed of the processor. The clock speed is defined as the clock cycles per second, which determines the rate at which instruction processing takes place. It is usually measured in megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz). Computer speed is one of the leading parameters in assessing a computer's performance. It can be compared to the horsepower of an engine. The higher the horsepower, the faster the car can move.

        12) Computer Accuracy:- Accuracy is a term used to describe anything that is near its true value or recognized standard. For example, a computer may perform an accurate math calculation that is correct with the information given, but is not the exact value.

        Relationship between Failure, Error and Fault
        Failure:- A failure is the non-performance or inability of the system or component to perform its intended function for a specified time under specified environmental conditions. A failure is a behavior or an event.
        Error:- An error is a design flaw or deviation from a desired or intended state. An error might lead to a failure unless something constructive is done. A failure in turn might lead to a new erroneous state                                                                            
        Fault:-  A fault is the adjudicated cause for an error. Generally, a failure is a fault but not vice versa, since a fault does not necessarily lead to a failure. 
        Primary fault (and failure)- is caused by an error in the software so that the computer output does not meet its specification. 
        Secondary fault (and failure)- occurs when the input to a computer does not comply with the specification. This can happen when the computer and the software are used in an environment not designed for it.
        Command fault- occurs when the computer delivers the correct result but at the wrong time or in the wrong order. This is typically a real time fault.

        <br><br>
        <b> PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT</b><br>
        Performance Measurement:-  This tells what a program did and how well it did it.
        Evaluation:- This tells the program’s effect on the people, families, or communities it is serving, ie whether a program is producing results or having an impact.
        What is impact?
        This refers to the net effect of a program relative to what would have happened had the program not existed. These are changes in the outcomes produced by the program alone and not caused by other factors. Impact typically reflects direct outcomes of a program i.e. persistent changes in participant‘s situation or behavior. Impacts can be either intended [i.e. those meant to be caused by the program] or unintended [i.e. those incidental to the program’s original goals or objectives].

        Performance Measurement involves collecting and reporting data that can be used to summarize and access the way a program is being implemented. Performance measurement data, to best improve program performance, are collected and accessed while participants are being served rather than only after a program cycle has concluded. Why do we measure performance?
        Performance measurement is not an end in itself. Because they may find such measures helpful in achieving eight specific managerial purposes. As part of their overall management strategy, public managers can use performance measures to evaluate, control, budget, motivate, promote, celebrate, learn, and improve.
        Questions that performance measurement data can answer include:
        a. Inputs 
        -What staff/volunteers are involved in the program?
        -What is the program budget? 
        -What equipment and materials does the program have?
        -How were all the inputs used? 
        b. Program Participation 
        -Who is participating [i.e. participant characteristics]?
        -How many participants are there?
        -How much did each person participate (especially relatives to a desired level of service)
        c. Outputs
        - What services are delivered?
        - Who delivered the services?
        -How well are services being delivered? 
        d. Outcomes
        - What changes do we observe in participants?

        <b>Concept in Performance Modeling and Analysis</b><br>
        Event:- An event describes an entity of interest in our system. Events usually represent some action - for example, the beginning of a clock cycle or the end of a clock cycle. The beginning of a computer's instruction execution cycle is another event, as is the end of the cycle, the reading of a memory location, the initiation of a block data transfer from a secondary storage device, and the initiation of a process or task. All of these represent events of interest to the computer engineer or computer architect. Events, representing actions within our computer system, must all be controlled, so that the sequencing or ordering (partial or total ordering) of these actions contributes to the accomplishment of some larger event. For example, the simple computer clock cycle is used to mark the beginning of an instruction's execution in a computer. The rising edge of the clock is used by the processor to begin execution of the current instruction in the instruction register and to prepare the next instruction for execution. The multitude of parallel events being performed during each and every clock cycle of the computer system's clock must be synchronized so that the designed intentions are realized.
        In terms of performance assessment the system analyst must have an understanding of the events within the system under study and the relationship of these events among each other. For example, we need to know that a file access event is composed of the disk access event, memory page replacement algorithm event, and the main memory load and store events. In addition to knowing the events involved with a higher-order event, event orderings must also be understood.

        The events, as we saw earlier, represent all of the real actions that occur in the computer system under study. These events form a hierarchy of relationships, where the finer, granular events are used to construct the coarse-grained events in the system. 

        State:- Given a set of possible events and their values, we can describe a valid "state" for the computer system under study. State is an important concept when considering any computer system. The state, S, is defined as the set of all events in our system along with valid values for their condition within the defined state. This can be described as follows: 
        S={E1(value), E2 (value), E3 (value) ..... En (value)}
        where each of the events must have all component events valid, and their own values must define valid states. For example, a state for a central processing unit may be defined as being composed of the following events and values: 
        • The program counter address held in the program counter 
        • The instruction held in the instruction register 
        • The status and value of the index register 
        • The status and values in the condition control register 
        • The value in the arithmetic logic unit temporary registers 
        • The value on the data bus 
        • The value on the address bus 
        • The value in the memory data register 
        Once we have definitions for the events and the state of the system, we can then begin to discuss the concept of measuring quantities within the system.

        Intervals:- Measurement requires that we have a domain or environment in which we are measuring. In computer systems the environment is the systems clocks and the instruction execution cycle. Another major environment is the high-order systems functions. In order to measure these items we need to focus on their interval of execution. An interval represents a period of time bounding the initiation of an event sequence of interest and the end of this event sequence. Intervals are used as a means to measure an event's sequences period of execution or the period of time between such executions. Two intervals are the same if they represent the same sequence of events (they are related) and the time interval between the events is equivalent. Two intervals representing two separate sequences of different events can also have equivalent intervals, but they are unrelated.

        Independence:- Another very important concept in performance modeling and analysis is that of independence. An action or event is considered independent of another event or action if the occurrence of one does not influence the outcome of the other. In a computer system, two programs that cannot run concurrently with each other can be viewed as independent items and analyzed as such. Even though they run on the same hardware and possibly use the same operating systems software, since they cannot interfere with each other and are not dependent in terms of sequencing, they can be evaluated as separate, unrelated items. It becomes an important part of our modeling and analysis of a system to define all elements and their relationship to each other. These definitions can then be used to aid in the determination of independence.

        Randomness:- Randomness is a property of an event and its reoccurrence. If an event is random, it implies that there is not a pattern that can be mapped onto the events to determine when they will occur again. Randomness is difficult, if not impossible, to prove. A random sequence of trials is the realization of the property of independence defined in the previous section. Randomness is a mathematical concept. In mathematics we think of random numbers coming from a random infinite source. In practice, there are finite sequences of available numbers, and once they are generated they now have a pattern. For example, if we roll the die, before we roll it we have no idea which number will occur; but after it is rolled there is only one outcome. In a computer system, the events caused by external sources (e.g., user key strokes, remote calls to a server) can be viewed as random events. Thus, their occurrence cannot be predicted ahead of time nor can the future after the last occurrence. This concept becomes very important when we wish to analyze our computer systems using mathematical concepts. 



        Workloads:- The workload or load represents the events or event sequences presented to the system to model or drive the system under study. The load represents how many of some event sequence are being offered for execution during some given period of time. 

        The load characterizes the quantity and the nature of requests submitted to the system. An example may be the number of instructions per second and the mix of instruction types presented for execution per second. The combination of the volume and the mix is important, as well as the duration of the load. The duration may be all at once, requiring the system to queue up the requests and perform them as resources become available. This type of mix and load would saturate the system up front and then decay to no load as the items get processed. The duration could be endless, with the load continually refreshed to provide a constant saturation or equilibrium load to the system. Loads can be periodic, where the instructions are presented all at once for service and then allowed to be processed. The load is then reentered after the prescribed period of time has passed, providing another spike in processing requirement. There is a science to workload development and selection for the computer systems modeler. For example, the database community has developed a set of transactional workloads aimed at testing a variety of database systems configurations. This set of transactions and the underlying database system have been developed over a number of years through the measurement of real database systems and the need to evaluate databases against each other with a known well-formed set of loads. Likewise, the personal computer industry has also developed a set of systems workloads aimed at allowing customers to assess the performance of one computer architecture against another.

        The load characterizes the quantity and the nature of requests submitted to the system. Consider for example the problem of quantifying the performance of a web server. We could characterize the load by a simple concept such as the number of requests per second. This is called the intensity of the workload. In general, the performance deteriorates when the intensity increases, but often the deterioration is sudden;

        <b>Computer System Performance Measures</b><br>
            Responsiveness:- These measures are intended to evaluate how quickly a given task can be accomplished by the system. Possible measures are waiting time, queue length etc 
            Usage level:- These measures are intended to evaluate how well the various components of the system are being used. Possible measures are throughput and utilization of various resources. 
            Missionability:- These measures indicate if the system would remain continuously operational for the duration of a particular period of time. Possible missionability measures the distribution of the work accomplished during the mission time interval availability (probability that the system will keep performing include satisfactorily throughout the mission time), and the life-time (time when the probability of unacceptable behavior increases beyond some threshold).
            Dependability:- These measures indicate how reliable the system is over the long run. Possible measures are the number of failures per day, MTTF (mean time to failure), MTTR (mean time to repair), long-term availability, and the cost of a failure.
            Productivity:- These measures indicate how effectively a user can get his or her work accomplished. Possible measures are user-friendliness, maintainability and understandability.

        Application Domains
            General Purpose Computing 
        These systems are designed for general purpose problem solving. Relevant measures are responsiveness, usage level, and productivity. Dependability requirements are modest, especially for benign failures (mild, non-threatening, not malignant)
            High Availability
        Such systems are designed for transaction processing environments (banks, airlines, or telephone databases, switching systems etc). The most important measures are responsiveness and dependability. Both of these requirements are more sever (separate, disunited) than for general purpose computing systems. Productivity is also an important factor. 
            Real time control
        Such systems must respond to both periodic and randomly occurring events within some (possibly hard) timing constraints. They require high levels of responsiveness and dependability for most workloads and failure types and are therefore significantly over designed. Note that the utilization and throughput pay little role in such.
            Mission oriented
        These systems require high levels of reliability over a short period, called the mission time. Little or no repair or tuning is possible during the mission. Such systems include fly-by-wire airplanes, battle field systems and space crafts. Responsiveness is also important, but usually not difficult to achieve. Such systems may try to achieve high reliability during short term at the expense of poor reliability beyond mission period.
            Long life
        Systems like the ones used in unmanned spaceships need long life without provision for manual diagnostics and repairs. Thus, in addition to being highly dependable, they should have considerable intelligence built in to do diagnostics and repair either automatically or by remote control from a ground station. Responsiveness is important but not difficult to achieve.

        <b>EVALUATION</b><br>
        “When the cook tastes the soup, that’s formative, when the guest tastes the soup, that’s summative” Robert Stakes.
        A computer performance evaluation is defined as the process by which a computer system's resources and outputs are assessed to determine whether the system is performing at an optimal level. Through effective performance measurement, program staff can collect much valuable data which however, cannot directly answer questions about program impact not can performance measurement data necessity answer all questions about how a system program is working or how results were achieved. To answer these questions, evaluation methods are needed.

        Evaluation covers a variety of activities that provide evidence about what a system program did and whether (or how well) it achieved its aims. While these evaluations, methods, if done well, can provide valuable information about a program system, not all measure provide generalizable conclusions about whether a program /system was effective.    
        Types of Evalution
        a) Formative Evaluation
        -- Planning study
        -- Process study
        b) Summative Evaluation
        -- Experimental study
        -- Comparison study

        Evaluation results depend on evaluation’s internal validity [how accurately an evaluation measures a program’s impact on outcomes for the population it is serving] and evaluation’s external validity [the extent to which conclusions about program impact can be reliably generalized to other populations, programs, geographies, or time spans than those studied].
         
         
        <br><br>
        <b>Formative Evaluative (FE)</b><br>
        The purpose of FE is to learn how a program is being designed or carried out, with the objective of providing information that can be used to improve implementation and results.
        (a)Planning study: This is a this is a type of formative evaluation which takes place during the design or planning phase to clarify a program’s plan and to make improvements at an early stage. These are some of the questions that can be addressed by a planning study:
            What are the goals and objectives of the system program?
            What population is the program and system intended to serve?
            Is the program intervention appropriate for the identified goals and population?
            What impact is the program expected to have?
            Are the available resources (staff, facilities, equipment, funding) adequate to    
        accomplish the program’s or system’s goals and objectives?
            Is the program’s implementation timeline achievable?

        b) Process study: formative evaluation can also be undertaken throughout implementation as an implementation or process study. A process study is important for program that are still developing, so that changes during the implementation phase can be clearly documented. A process study answers questions such as the following about the quality of program implementation: 
            What interventions were implemented?
            Did services get delivered as intended? Were the appropriate populations reached by the program? If not? Why not?
            Were the resources (staff, facilities, equipment, funding) sufficient to accomplish the program’s goals and objectives?
            Did staff encounter problems in setting up or running the program? Were they able to respond to and address all challenges?

        A process study can help a nonprofit understand why a program is getting or not getting particular results and provide information which leadership and staff can use to change the program as its being implemented.
            
        Formative evaluations use a variety of research method to achieve their objectives such as performance management data, surveys, direct observation of client or staff interviews or focus groups such as client or staff or other means, to supplement routine performance management data. Data gathered can be analyzed by the organization using summary table or chat.
        <br><br>
        <b>Summative Evaluation [SE]</b><br>
        This looks retrospectively at what a program accomplishes. The purpose of SE is to learn how effectively a program has changed the condition described in the theory of change and logic model – specifically, to determine the program’s impact on those conditions. Summative Evaluation can help funders determine whether additional resources to serve more people would be a good investment. On the other hand, nonprofit or funders might decide that a program failing to show positive impact should be redesigned or phased out. 
        Two types of summative evaluations intended to measure impact include:
        a) Experimental study (randomized control trial):- This is the most reliable way to determine a program impact. Here, the program participants (the treatment group) and the nonparticipants (the control group) are selected at random from the same population. This eliminates the risk of self-selection bias (the possibility that people who choose to participate will differ in some way from those who do not). If properly done, Experimental study has a high degree of internal validity in measuring program impact.
        b) Comparison study (quasi-experimental study):- Here, changes in outcome from program participant (the treatment group) will be compared to changes for a comparison group that resembles the program participants group as much as possible. 
        In both experimental and comparison studies, a valid Summative evaluation can help determine a program’s effect on the people, families, or communities it serves and its result or impact. In other words, a Summative evaluation answers a fairly straight forward questions. Did the program work and if so, so how well?

        The following criteria can be used to access a programs summative evaluation readiness:
        i) Relevance and importance of program impact question: A summative evaluation fundamentally addresses the question of program impact. Before proceeding, the nonprofit and its funders should establish that answering this question is relevant to the program and likely to be of high value to the community being served. 
        ii) Applicability, Scalability, and Replicability: Since summative evaluations have high costs, funding should be prioritized towards evaluating a program that would be wildly relevant to the field or applicable to other sites. Ideally, the program should be scalable and replicable. 
        iii) Organizational capacity and scale: The program should be well implemented and managed and have the operational capacity to help implement the evaluation. Further, the program should give sufficient participants, or be capable of grouping large enough to support an evaluation.
        iv) Program stability:  Should record stable service delivery for multiple years and should help evaluators access discrete changes in program design 
        v) Adequate funding for program operations and evaluations
        vi) Buying and research planning participation from staff: Both evaluators and nonprofit staff should see the evaluation as a partnership, have an equal commitment to the study’s fidelity and success, and be willing to listen and to contribute to making it work.

        <b>Differences between Performance Measurement and Evaluation</b><br>
        Though the dividing line between performance measurement and evaluation (formative) can be blurry, a few things can generally distinguish them.
        i) Performance measurement is ongoing while evaluation is discrete. Performance measurement is part of a continuous improvement process, in which data are collected, analyzed and reported as close to real time as possible, giving staff immediate and actionable feedback on a program’s status. Evaluation is not done continuously but rather during particular periods of a program’s development or implementation and covers a specified time frame. For example, a formative evaluation may be carried out during the first 6 months of the program’s planning and implementation while a summative evaluation might be done during the fifth year of an established program. 
        ii) Performance measurement is responsive and adaptive while evaluation answers a predetermined set of questions. 
        iii) While performance measurement exploits program and outcome data, which can also be used in evaluation, evaluation usually involves other data collection and research methods. 
        iv) Performance measurement is mostly done by program staff, whereas evaluation is typically carried out by people outside the program.

        <br><br><b>Techniques for Performance Evaluation</b><br>
        The first step is to clearly define the goal of the performance evaluation, as discussed in the previous section. Once the goal is identified, it remains to define a metric and a load model. All of this requires knowing the system and its use. The performance evaluation can then proceed with a solution method, which usually falls in one of the three cases below. Which method to use depends on the nature of the problem and the skills or taste of the evaluation team.
        1. Measurement of the Real System: This is the most fundamental technique and is needed even in analysis and simulation to calibrate the models. Some measurements are best done in hardware, software or in hybrid manner. It is hard to measure without disturbing the system but with some special hardware devices (e.g.: optical splitters in network links) disturbance sometimes can be prevented. If, in contrast measurements are taken by the system itself, the impact has to be analyzed carefully. Measurements are not always possible (e.g. if the system does not exist yet). It sometimes requires a complex instrumentation.

        2. Discrete Event Simulation Modeling: This is the most widespread method. It involves constructing a model for the behavior of the system and driving it with an appropriate abstraction of the work load. That is, a simplified model of the system and its load are implemented in software. Time is simulated and typically flows orders of magnitude more slowly than real time. The performance of interest is measured as on a real system, but measurement side effects are usually not present. It is often easier than a measurement study, but not always. The major advantage of Simulation is its generality and flexibility, almost any behavior can be easily simulated.
        Both measurement and simulation involve careful experiment design, data gathering, and data analysis. These steps could be tedious; moreover, the final results obtained from the data analysis only characterize the system behavior for the range of input parameters covered. Although exploration can be used to obtain result for the nearby parameter values, it is not possible to ask “what if” questions for arbitrary values. 

        3. Analytic Modeling: This involves constructing a mathematical model of the system behavior (at the desired level of details) and solving it. The main difficulty here is that the domain of tractable models is rather limited. Thus, analytic modeling will fail if the objective is to study the behavior in great details. However, for an overall behavior characterization, analytic modelling is an excellent tool.
        The major advantages of analytic modelling over measurement and simulation modelling are:
        a) It generates good insight into the working of the system that is valuable even if the model is too difficult to solve. 
        b) Simple analytic models can usually be solved easily, yet provide surprisingly accurate results. 
        c) Results from analysis have better predictive value than those obtained from measurement or simulation. 

        4. Hybrid Modeling: A complex model may consist of several sub-models, each representing certain aspect of the system. Only some of these sub models may be analytically tractable, the others may be simulated.

        <b>The Art of Performance Evaluations </b>
            Successful evaluations cannot be produced mechanically.
            Evaluation requires detailed knowledge of the system to be modeled. 
            Careful selection of methodology, workload, and tools.
            Conversion from an abstract feeling or notion to a real problem which needs to be formalized in a way that can be handled by established tools. 
            Analysts tend to have different styles.

        <b>SYSTEMATIC PERFORMANCE EVALUATION </b>
        A Systematic Approach to Performance Evaluation 
        How should one carry out a performance evaluation study? The following is a six-step methodology which provides the performance analyst with a systematic approach to performance evaluation and point out some common mistakes that can be avoided: 
            Understand the current environment and define goals for analysis. 
            Identify and gather relevant performance metrics. 
            Select the appropriate evaluation technique. 
            Define characteristic workloads. 
            Analyze and interpret the data. 
            Present the results. 


        Step One - Define Your Goals 
        There is no such thing as an all-purpose system performance model. Each model must be developed with an understanding of the system and the problem to be solved. Therefore, the first step in conducting a performance evaluation study is to clearly state the goals of the project and obtain a global definition of the current environment based on these goals. Setting goals involves deliberate interaction with system users and decision makers, taking care to avoid any preconceived biases or beliefs. Conclusions and recommendations should be based on the results of the model rather than on what one party wants to hear. The definition of the computing environment may vary depending upon the goals of the study. The system definition may consist of the CPU, memory or I/O subsystem, the network, the database, or the entire computing system itself. How the environment is defined affects the choice of performance metrics and workloads needed to compare alternative objectives. At a minimum, the overall description should include the following system components: hardware configuration, operating system, support software, and major applications. In addition, a list of services provided by these components and an understanding of existing service level agreements, user profiles, administrative controls, peak time windows and possible alternatives and problems should be part of the preliminary examination the system environment. A large share of the analysis effort of a performance problem goes into defining the problem and stating the goals. Putting a lot of effort into this initial step helps to narrow the scope of the study and reduces the time and cost required to find the solution. Analysis without understanding the problem or goals of the study will only result in inaccurate conclusions. A Systematic Approach to Performance Evaluation 

        Step Two - Choosing Performance Metrics 
        Once the goals of the performance study have been defined and you have a clear understanding of the system or systems to be evaluated, you can move on to identifying and gathering relevant performance metrics. The choice of metrics may depend on the tools available to you for collecting and measuring system data, and vice versa. An understanding of the type of data available through accounting logs, hardware and software monitors, load generators, program analyzers, and other measurement tools is helpful in this step. Then, depending on the objectives of the study, data collection should take place during a typical (if averages are being studied) or peak (if system capacity is of concern) time period. It is also important to consider the constraints and limitations imposed by the alternatives being studied and the time available for the decision when choosing your metrics. Most importantly, your choice of performance metrics should depend upon the goals of the study. A common mistake is to choose those metrics that can be easily computed or measured rather than those that are relevant to your objectives. Examples of commonly used performance metrics are throughput and response time. But, care must be taken when using even these standard metrics. For example, if the objective of your study is to compare the expected throughput of two alternative systems, you may run into complications during the analysis phase of your evaluation comparing the MIPS measured on one system to the VUPS reported by another. Furthermore, understanding exactly how a metric, such as response time, is measured and reported plays a role in building your performance model. Ignoring important parameters, choosing inappropriate metrics, or overlooking differences in metrics from one system to another may render your results useless. A good way to start identifying relevant performance metrics is to make a list of all the system and workload metrics that affect the performance of the system(s) under consideration. In general, the metrics will be related to the speed, accuracy, and availability of system services. System parameters include both hardware and software parameters and may include such measurements as working set size or CPU clock speed. The global definition of the computing environment created in step one should be of help in defining the system parameters. Workload parameters are characteristics of users' requests such as traffic intensity, system load, and resource consumption. Pay special attention to those workload parameters that will be affected by your alternative performance objectives as well as those that have a significant impact on performance – CPU utilization, total I/O operations, memory usage, page faults, and elapsed time. As a final note, it is important to understand the randomness of the system and workload parameters that affect the performance of your system. Some of the metrics you've identified and gathered in this step will be varied during the evaluation while others will not. Observing system behavior for several days or weeks will allow you to determine realistic values and distributions for each metric included in the analysis. The ability to accurately reflect system behavior in your model through the use of relevant metrics will lead to much tighter conclusions. 

        Step Three - Selecting the Appropriate Evaluation Technique 
        Performance management is the process of ensuring that a computer system meets predefined performance objectives consistently and efficiently, both now and in the future. In order to evaluate future system behavior, the analyst must use predictive models. There are four modeling techniques commonly used for performance management: linear projection; analytic modeling; simulation; and benchmarking. Each method has its own merits and drawbacks and, in some cases, choosing one technique over another may be a simple matter of economics. Knowing what data, tools, and skills are available, what level of accuracy or detail is required, how much time and money is devoted to the project, and whether the alternatives to be evaluated exist or have yet to be developed all play a key role in determining which technique should, or can, be used. Linear projection involves collecting past data, extending or implying trends through the use of scatter plots and regression lines, and comparing the trend line with the current capacity of the system. Although linear projection A Systematic Approach to Performance Evaluation is used quite frequently to make assumptions about future behavior, the performance of computer systems is far from linear. Therefore, any linear relationship determined between two system components should only be used to understand the current (or past) behavior. Linear projection is best used when you want a first approximation to a very simple model. Analytic modeling uses queuing theory formulas and algorithms to predict response times and utilization projections from workload characterization data and key system relationships. Basically, analytic models require input data such as arrival rates, user profiles, and service demands placed by each workload on various system resources. System monitors and accounting logs can provide most or all of the required information. Most analytic models allow for the use of various assumptions in order to keep the solution simple and efficient. The effect of these assumptions on the accuracy of your conclusions must be considered when making recommendations. Analytic modeling is best used when a numeric prediction is needed, when workload forecasts are fairly accurate, when a best-case/worst-case situation holds, or when an accurate answer can save significant money, time, or headaches. Simulation models are based on computer programs that emulate the different behavioral aspects of a system under evaluation. They allow for the investigation of system behavior at any level of detail, but not without cost. The fine level of detail (input data) generally required to build simulation models often makes them expensive to undertake. While linear projection and analytic models can be solved with pen and paper or simple PC-based applications, simulation models typically require powerful workstations or even mainframes. Simulation is best used when there are important questions about details of such things as the dispatching algorithm or application and device internals that are not answered by analytic modeling, or when the proper experience in simulation exists or can be bought. Benchmarking is a useful approach for predicting the capacity of new computer systems or testing the impact of new workloads, databases, or operating systems on existing systems. Because of the high cost involved in conducting a benchmark study, the analysis of multiple alternatives may be prohibitive. The accuracy of benchmarking results can vary from high (testing a real workload on an existing system) to none (testing undeveloped workloads or prototype systems). Other considerations include: generating the needed files; ensuring repeatability; representative accuracy; and time to prepare. Benchmark experiments are best used when you can't get an accurate estimate of a workload's resource usage in another way. It is clear that the goals of a study and the data and resources available have a significant impact on what is modeled and how it is analyzed. In all cases, the accuracy of your conclusions relies on how well the model and the data used to feed the model represent the real system. 

        Step Four - Defining Characteristic Workloads 
        Workload characterization involves studying the user and machine environment, observing key characteristics, and developing a workload model that can be used repeatedly. Once a workload model is available, the effect of changes in the workload and system can be easily evaluated by changing the parameters of the model. In addition, workload characterization can help you to determine what's normal, prepare a baseline for historical comparison, comply with management reporting, and identify candidates for optimization. Typically, you'll find that the alternatives you're asked to evaluate are stated in business- or user-oriented units instead of machine-oriented units. For example, you'll be asked to model the performance impact of adding six new point-of-sale terminals in the northeast or of changing how the current billing application is run. The advantage of user-oriented units is that the users can easily relate to them and can frequently give a good forecast of future workload. The disadvantage is that they do not automatically relate to system resources used by a workload. As the performance analyst, you must quantify the relationships -- turn an increase in the number of A Systematic Approach to Performance Evaluation terminals into an increase in total resources used by each workload class. It is not guaranteed that a good relationship exists. Using the user-oriented information from your study of the environment (Step 1) and the system measures gathered in Step 2, you need to divide the total system workload into workload classes. A workload class is a combination of transactions that have enough in common to be considered one homogeneous workload. The goal is to have complete coverage of system workload with no overlap of classes. Depending upon the evaluation technique being used (Step 3), workloads may be characterized in different forms. Some attributes used for classifying a workload include: resource usage, application type, geographical orientation, visibility, organizational unit, processing type, and similar growth, shrinkage, or stagnation. At times, it may be appropriate to use multiple criteria to define a single class. Regardless of how you choose to characterize the workload classes, the resulting workload model should capture quantitative information about the real system workload. In choosing the parameters to characterize each workload class, it is best to use those related to workload service demand or intensity such as arrival rate, number of terminals and think time, number of concurrent programs, or duration of request, rather than parameters that depend on the system. For example, since a transaction's response time is dependent on the system on which it is executed, response time is not a good choice for a workload parameter. Remember, you want to build a single workload model that can be repeatedly used to evaluate a variety of scenarios. After the parameters have been selected, you need to assign appropriate values to them. Two popular techniques for calculating parameter values include averaging and cluster analysis. If you use averaging, test the variability in your measures using statistical techniques such as mean variance, standard deviation and range. Clustering analysis can be used to identify natural groupings for the parameter values based on similar traits. Various clustering algorithms are available in literature. Like other aspects of performance management, proper selection of workload classes requires a lot of judgment by the analyst. Care should be taken to assure that your workload model accurately reflects the services exercised by the real system workload since the wrong workload may lead to inaccurate conclusions. 


        Step Five - Analyzing and Interpreting the Data 
        Armed with the proper workloads and data and with a thorough understanding of the environment and goals of the evaluation, you are ready to run your model and compare it against actual system measurements. Calibration techniques may be required if your system and workload models don't readily match observed system behavior. Commonly accepted techniques to validate and calibrate performance models are available in literature. Once the model is verified and the results appear to be representative of the real system, you are ready to use this baseline model to compare alternative scenarios. The results of each run of the model will provide the information needed to draw conclusions about the set of proposed alternatives. Interpreting these results and providing supporting documentation is where the analyst truly earns his or her keep. Erroneous analysis is as bad as no analysis. The number and type of assumptions or adjustments incorporated into your input parameters or model may have an effect on how robust your model is at reflecting actual behavior. It is important to adjust the level of confidence on the model output based on the input data or model used. Conclusions made about each alternative should take into account the variability and randomness of the results. Statistical techniques to test for variability may include regression analysis, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. None of your recommendations should be based on conclusions that are extremely sensitive to small changes in the model parameters. Sensitivity analysis should be used to assure that your conclusions won't drastically change if the workloads or parameters used in your model are changed slightly. Sensitivity analysis is also helpful in assessing the relative importance of various parameters and how they impact desired service levels. A Systematic Approach to Performance Evaluation In an attempt to save time and money and simplify the task of workload characterization, future workload and system behavior is typically assumed to be a modification of current or past behavior. To improve the validity of your results, any predicted effects of the strategic plans of the company or key economic indicators should be incorporated into your analysis. Furthermore, restricting how far into the future your workload predictions are made will help simplify the task of analyzing the results. Don't waste time comparing alternatives that the decision-makers cannot or will not adopt either because they are beyond their control or don't fit into their personal agendas. Preference should be given to those alternatives that can be easily implemented, have a low associated cost or risk, or meet the qualifications defined in the statement of goals. A selection of alternatives should be analyzed and presented though, so that the decision makers may choose the most appropriate option. 

        Step Six - Presenting the Results 
        The final step of all performance projects is to communicate the results of your analysis to the decision-makers. Since the project report is the primary deliverable for any study, it is particularly important that it be clear and reliable. It should give specific, practical findings and recommendations, with little technical jargon and no vague generalities. The project report should serve as a valuable reference and as a convenient baseline for comparing future performance with current performance. Acceptance of the analysis results requires developing a trust between the decision-makers and the analyst. A key factor in effectively establishing trust and communicating your conclusions is knowing your audience. Understanding their level of technical expertise and, more importantly, their motive for initiating the study will be helpful in organizing your report and assuring that the right questions are answered. The primary reasons for initiating the study may include: user dissatisfaction; external image of the company; productivity decreases; budgetary constraints; or risk of financial loss. Non-technical decision-makers are rarely interested in the modeling technique you used or how it is implemented. Their primary interest is the guidance that the model provides and the political impact the recommendation may have. Technical members may be more concerned with the assumptions and limitations of the analysis or the availability of personnel to implement a particular course of action. The project report should include a summation of all the analysis that has been performed by the analyst, show resource utilization levels of the current system, and identify hardware and software alternatives which will satisfy future processing requirements. The report should include enough data tables and figures to support the major findings, and clearly identify the data sources that support each finding. Finally, it should provide an estimate of the time, cost, and feasibility of implementing a solution. 
        In addition to submitting a project report, you may have the opportunity to participate in a project briefing. A project briefing allows you to explain the results of the study to management and technical staff. It also gives you the opportunity to answer in-depth questions concerning the implementation of any corrective actions being recommended. Again, appropriate use of words, pictures, and graphs to explain the results and analysis should be used.

        Ten steps:
        1. State goals of the study and define the system
        --Identical hardware and software yet, the system may vary depending on goals. 
        --The chosen system boundaries affect the performance metrics as well as the workload used  
            to compare the systems.
        --Additionally, administrative control of the sponsors of the study. Sponsors may want to keep uncontrollable components out of the system boundaries.
        2. List services and outcomes
        Network: send packets to a specified destination.
        Processor: perform a number of different instructions. 
        Database: respond to queries
        --Also list the possible outcomes, example database query: correctly, incorrectly, not at all.
        3. Select metrics 
            --Criteria to compare the performance: usually speed, accuracy, and availability. 
        --Network: throughput, delay(speed), error rate (accuracy) 
        --CPU: time to execute various instructions (speed)
        4. List parameters that affect performance 
        --System parameters (both hardware and software) workload parameters (characteristics of user’s requests) the list of parameters may not be complete, parameters may be added, always keep list as comprehensive as possible. 
        5. Select factors to study
            --Factors: parameters that are varied during the evaluation
        --Levels: values of a factor
        --Limited resources: start with a short list and extend if the resources permit.
        --Choose parameters expected to have high impact as factors
        --Also consider economic, political, technological constraints and decision makers. 
        6. Select technique for evaluation
            --Analytical modelling, simulation, measuring a real system
        --Depends on time, resources and the desired level of details 
        7. Select workload
        --List of service request to the system
        --Depends on the evaluation technique: probability of various requests (analytical), trace of 
            request from real system (simulation), user script (measurement)
        --Representative workload often require to measure and characterize the workload on existing  
            systems 
        8. Design experiment: maximize information with minimum efforts
        Two phases:
        1st: many factors, only few levels determine relative effect on factors 
        2nd: few most significant factors, increase the number of levels
        9. Analyze and interpret data:
        --Consider the variability of simulation and measurement results. Use statistics
        --Interpretation is the key part of the analyst: analysis produces results but no conclusion or 
        decision. 
        --Analyst’s conclusion may be different given the same set of results
        10.  Present results:
        --Communicate the result to the other member of the decision making team.
        --Information needs to be easily understood 
        --No statistical jargon 
        --Choose graphic form with proper scaling of graphs
        --At this point: reconsider and question some of the decisions made in the previous steps (e.g. System boundaries, factors, or metrics)   
        --The complete evaluation project consists of several cycles rather than a single sequential 
            pass.
                
        <b>Applications of Performance Evaluations</b>
        1. System design: In designing a new system, one typically starts out with certain performance and reliability objectives and a basic system architecture, and then decides how to choose various parameters to achieve the objectives. This involves constructing a model of the system behavior at the appropriate level of details, and evaluating it to choose the parameters. At higher levels of design, simple analytic reasoning may be adequate to eliminate bad choices, but simulation becomes an indispensable tool for making detailed design decisions and avoiding costly mistakes.
        2. System selection: Here the problem is to select the best system from among a group of system that are under consideration for reasons of cost, availability, compatibility etc. Although direct measurement is the ideal technique to use here, there might be practical difficulties in doing so (e.g. not being able to use them under realistic workloads, or not having the system available locally). Therefore, it may be necessary to make projections based on available data and some simple modeling.
        3. System upgrade: This involves replacing either the entire system or part thereof with a newer but compatible unit. The compatibility and cost considerations may dictate the vendor, so the only remaining problem is to choose quantity, speed and the like.
        Often, analytic modeling is adequate here. However, in large system involving complex interactions between subsystems, simulation modeling may be essential. Note that a direct experimentation would require installing the new unit first, and thus is not practical.
        4. System tuning: The purpose of tune up is to optimize the performance by appropriately changing the various resource management policies. It is necessary to decide which parameters to consider changing and how to change them to get maximum potential benefits. Direct experimentation is the simplest technique to use here, but may not be feasible in a production environment. Since the tuning often involves changes to aspects that cannot be easily represented in analytic models, simulation is indispensable in this application.
        5. System analysis: Suppose that we find a system to be unacceptably sluggish, the reason could be either inadequate hard ware resources or poor system management. In the former case, we need system upgrade, and in the later, a system tune-up. Nevertheless, the first task is to determine which of the two cases applies. This involves monitoring the system and examining the behavior of various resource management policies, under different loading conditions. 

        Experimentation with simple analytic reasoning is usually adequate to identify the trouble spots; however, in some cases, complex interactions may make a simulation study essential. 

        System Workload
        This refers to a set of input generated by the environment in which the system is used, example, the inter-arrival times and service demands of incoming jobs, and are usually not under control of the system designer and administrator. These inputs can be used for driving the real system (as in measurement) or its simulation model, and for determining the distributions for analytic or simulation modeling.

        Workload Characterization
        This is one of the central issues in performance evaluation because it is not always clear what aspect of the workload are important, in how much details the workload should be recorded, and how the workload should be represented and used. Workload characterization only builds a model of the real workload, since not every aspect of the real workload may be captured or is relevant.

        A workload model may be executable or non-executable. For example, recording the arrival instants and service duration of the jobs creates an executable model, whereas only determining the distribution creates a non-executable model. An executable model need not be a record of inputs; it can also be a program that generates the inputs. Executable workloads are useful in direct measurement and trace driven simulations whereas non-executable workloads are useful for analytic modelling and distribution driven simulations. 

        <b>Factors Affecting Computer System Performance</b>
        i) Number of Processors (cores)
        A CPU can contain one or more processing units. Each unit is called a core. A core contains an ALU, control unit and registers. It is common for computers to have two (dual), four (quad) or even more cores. CPUs with multiple cores have more power to run multiple programs at the same time. However, doubling the number of cores will not simply double a computer's speed. CPU cores have to communicate with each other through channels and this uses up some of the extra speed. Therefore, if we increase the number of cores in a processor, there will be an increase in system performance.
        ii) Width of the data bus
        The data bus is a set of parallel wires or connectors that transports data between the processor and main memory. By increasing the data bus from 32-bit to 64-bit, the computer can transfer twice as much information at one time. Therefore, increasing the size of the data bus improves the system performance of the computer.

        iii) Clock Speed
        The clock speed - also known as clock rate - indicates how fast the CPU can run. This is measured in megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (gHz) and corresponds with how many instruction cycles the CPU can deal with in a second. A 2 gHz CPU performs two billion cycles a second. The larger this number is, the faster the CPU is, and the more heat is produced. A faster CPU uses more energy and creates more heat. A computer will normally have a maximum clock speed set by default, but it is possible to change this speed in the computer BIOS. Some people increase a CPU clock speed to try to make their computer run faster - this is called overclocking.
        There are limits to how fast a CPU can run and its circuitry cannot always keep up with an overclocked speed. If the speed is too fast, you run the risk of not completing a computation before the next one is carried out. If the CPU cannot keep up with the pace of the clock, the data is corrupted. CPUs can also overheat if they are forced to work faster than they were designed to work.

        iv) RAM
        When the RAM capacity is too small, using the computer will become much slower as information needs to constantly be added to and removed from RAM. This will be especially noticeable when switching between two open applications since the computer would need to remove all the previously open application’s data from memory and replace it with the new application’s data. When this problem becomes serious enough, your computer might automatically close some applications to free up memory.
        v) Cache
        Computers often reuse actions, so in light of this, the cache is a type of memory that holds temporary instructions so that they needn’t be computed unnecessarily. Another form of memory is caching. Caching refers to a small, temporary form of storage that is created so that the data stored in the cache can be accessed more quickly. The CPU automatically makes checks in the cache for any instructions before requesting data from the RAM. By doing this, performance is increased because it saves using data unnecessarily. These transfers take a lot less time than a transfer to and from the RAM. The larger the cache, the more data can be stored close to the CPU. There are different forms of caching:
        a) Cache Memory
        Cache is a small amount of memory which is a part of the CPU - closer to the CPU than RAM. It is used to temporarily hold instructions and data that the CPU is likely to reuse. The CPU control unit automatically checks cache for instructions before requesting data from RAM. This saves fetching the instructions and data repeatedly from RAM – a relatively slow process which might otherwise keep the CPU waiting. Transfers to and from cache take less time than transfers to and from RAM. The more cache there is, the more data can be stored closer to the CPU.

        Cache is graded as Level 1 (L1), Level 2 (L2) and Level 3 (L3):
        •	L1 is usually part of the CPU chip itself and is both the smallest and the fastest to access. Its size is often restricted to between 8 KB and 64 KB.
        •	L2 and L3 caches are bigger than L1. They are extra caches built between the CPU and the RAM. Sometimes L2 is built into the CPU with L1. L2 and L3 caches take slightly longer to access than L1. The more L2 and L3 memory available, the faster a computer can run.
        Not a lot of physical space is allocated for cache. There is more space for RAM, which is usually larger and less expensive.
        b) CPU Cache: Due to the growing difference in speed between a computer’s CPU and RAM, many CPUs now have a small, high-speed cache built into the CPU where it can temporarily store the data it needs. The speed and size of the CPU cache can have a significant impact on a CPU’s performance.
        c) Disk Cache: The disk cache is a small amount of RAM that is built into a hard disk drive. It stores data being sent or received by the hard disk plates for a short period of time.
        d) Web Cache: The web cache is a small area on a computer’s hard drive where images and pages from the world wide web are stored for a short period of time. This allows users to quickly load those images from their computers, rather than over a slow internet connection, when they open a page that they have previously viewed.

        vi) Secondary Storage
        Secondary Storage (also called external memory or auxiliary storage) is not directly accessible to the CPU. The computer uses its Input/output channels to access secondary storage and transfer the desired data to primary storage. Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid State Drives (SSDs) are used as secondary storage. Other examples of secondary storage technologies include USB flash drives, Compact Disks (CDs), Digital Video disks (DVDs) external hard disk drives.

        vii) Speed
        The access time per byte for HDDs or SSDs is typically measured in milliseconds (one thousandth seconds), while the access time per byte for primary storage is measured in nanoseconds (one billionth seconds). Thus, secondary storage is significantly slower than primary storage. Rotating optical storage devices, such as CD and DVD drives, have even longer access times. Once the disk read/write head on HDDs reaches the proper placement and the data, subsequent data on the track are very fast to access. To reduce the seek time and rotational latency, data are transferred to and from disks in large contiguous blocks.

        When the computer uses up all available RAM it has to start using the hard drive to cache data, which is much slower. The constant transfer of data between RAM and virtual memory (hard drive memory) slows a computer down considerably. The biggest factor in your computer's performance is the hard disk speed.

        viii) Number of Cores (Processors)
        The CPU is where you’ll find the processing units, each one known as a core. Every core will contain a control unit, ALU, and registers. Usually, a PC will have either two or four cores, and the more you have, the more programs you can run at the same time.
        However, if you think that you can double your computer speed by doubling the number of cores, then think again! As they have to communicate with each other, this takes some of the speed away, but in general, increasing the number of cores is a great idea and will boost performance.
        
        ix) Multiple Applications Affecting Computer Speed
        Any kind of computer speed test will indicate a decrease in performance with an increase in the number of tasks running. Multitasking slows down your PC  cause applications have less memory to themselves. The more apps running at the same time, the slower your PC will be. It’s something to keep in mind when optimizing performance on your machine.

        x) Graphics Card Type
        When it comes to visuals, the user interface, pictures, videos, and more, a powerful graphics card is imperative to good performance. If you are using your PC to process a lot of graphics, you may want to know how to speed up computer performance by optimizing your graphics card in the BIOS, or you could purchase a more up-to-date one and swap the old one out. Graphics cards can be used to perform nonvisual computations, too, so don’t forget that they are important for general performance. If the computer's built-in graphics card shares the computer's memory, installing a graphics card will free up that memory for the computer to use in other tasks. Additionally, the memory built-in to a graphics card is usually faster than the memory the computer uses, which can also contribute to a performance boost.

        xi) Data Bus Width
        Between the processor and main memory, you have a series of connectors or wires known as the data bus. This is what helps transport data between these two components. When you increase your bus from 32 to 64 bit, you will be able to transfer at least twice as much at any given time. If you want to improve performance, think about increasing the size of your data bus.

        xii) Malware
        One of the best ways to speed up computer performance is actually to eliminate malware. Malware, spyware, and viruses can monitor your activity, take control of your computer, and create all sorts of complications that reduce performance. Anything unwanted and malicious is going to seriously affect performance, so make sure that you invest in a good antivirus to prevent such attacks on your computer. It will seriously help in the long run, and make sure that you scan your computer at least once every week to keep your antivirus updated and remove any unwanted junk from affecting the performance of your computer.
        
        xiii) Defragmentation
        Sometimes memory is not stored efficiently. When you run a defragmenter, fragmented data is rearranged so that your drives and disks can work more productively. With more space on them, this will also improve performance. Most defragmenters run on a schedule, so if you haven’t configured defragmentation to run regularly on your computer, then do so today.
        
        ix) Maintenance
        Even a computer made of the latest, best components still requires maintenance. It's important to install updates, keep the computer free of malware and perform regular upkeep. Updates from the operating system manufacturer and any hardware or software updates can help the computer run better or fix problems. Malware slows your computer down and can expose you to identity theft. An anti-virus program and regular scans will help you avoid those issues. Make sure to defragment your computer, clean up old files and shut it down regularly. Doing these things will help keep your system working quickly.

        x) Operating System:- Does OS affect computer speed?
        Some OS's will definitely run some applications faster than others, but which OS runs faster depends on the features being used. And there are reasons other than speed to choose one over another. Application availability, security, interoperability, device compatibility, availability of programming tools, etc.

        xi) Frame Rate
        Frame rate is the frequency in which a consecutive series of frames or images can appear on a display panel. It can also be referred to as “update rate” or “burst rate”. It applies not only to computer graphics in video games but to all motion capture systems including film and video cameras. This frequency is usually measured by frames per second (fps). For example, at 30 fps, 30 distinct images would appear in succession within one second. If the fps is too low, movement will appear jagged and jerky.

        But you can also run into problems if your fps is too high due to synchronization errors, which could overload your monitor and cause it to malfunction. Cameras, whether they’re moving or still, operate under the same principle. A lens opens for a period of time, light is exposed, and an image is captured, thus creating a “frame.”
        In the case of moving pictures, film is typically recorded or digitally captured and then converted between 24 to 60 fps for smooth transitions, whereas flipbook animation is usually around 12 fps. When we talk about monitors, we generally use the term hertz (Hz). 1 fps equals 1 Hz.
        If you were to do a frame rate comparison between a 60 Hz monitor and a 120 Hz monitor, you may not notice a significant difference, despite one being twice as fast as the other. However, there’d be a significantly noticeable gap in video quality when comparing 24 Hz to a 60 Hz console due to the latency in frame delivery.

        <b>Why does frame rate matter?</b>
        At a minimum, 24 fps is what you need for distinct frames to appear as one moving image, whether you’re streaming movies or battling online competition. However, the higher you go from this number, the faster and smoother your display quality and viewing experience will be.
        If you’re a serious gamer, playing on a quality monitor with an optimized FPS is an absolute must. Otherwise, your opponent might be able to see more quickly and leave you in the dust, while frustrating glitches and tears could separate the difference between victory and defeat.
        With a low frame rate speed, you could end up experiencing choppy video quality or major lag times when live streaming. If your monitor can’t keep up with the video game graphics, it might double or triple certain frames in the video feed, which creates a slow visual effect on your display. This might not be a big deal to low-key gamers, but if you’re trying to make it to the big leagues, one glitch can send you and your team to the bottom of the ranks. 
        
        The target frame rate for gamers is preferential, since having a steady connection with the graphics card is sometimes more important than having a fast one. PC action games are played best at 60 fps, but otherwise, a frame rate of 30 fps or higher should be fine.

        How to perform a frame rate test on your monitor
        Now that you understand how frame rate affects gameplay, you might be curious to see at what rate your current system is running. There are various ways to check your frame rate speed to see what performance you’re getting.
        Gamers who are playing with NVIDIA® graphics hardware that supports ShadowPlay can also enable an in-game fps counter. To set it up, Using the NVIDIA GeForce™ Experience
            Open the app settings
            Enable “Share” mode
            Click the “Overlays” button
            Select the “FPS Counter” tab
        You can also choose to have frame rate settings automatically applied to different game profiles for optimized in-game experience without having to tweak the graphics yourself.

        <b>Test using VideoLAN</b>
        If you’re not a Steam player and want to test your display fps, there are a handful of different programs you can use. VideoLAN is one option. It’s a free, open-source, multi-media player platform compatible with Xbox™ and most media files, including DVDs.
            Install VideoLAN
            Go into the Windows™ menu
            Select “Media Information”
            Go into the “Codec Details” tab
            Select the stream or video you want to know more about
            Once you get here, everything about your various frame rate speeds should be laid out for you to see.

        <b>How to increase your frame rate</b>
        If you run a frame rate test and decide you’d like to increase the speed of your frame rate for better transitions, there are a few methods you can try to before investing in a computer monitor with a faster Hz:
            Drop your resolution display settings to a lower contrast
            Change your video playback settings
            Update your graphics card drivers with better hardware
            Overclock your hardware
            Use PC optimization software that changes fps for you
        If these tips to boost your fps don’t work, it may be possible to manually change your frame rate yourself by going into your display settings and checking whether anything was potentially altered. When all else fails, it might be time to invest in a higher-quality monitor that can make your favorite games run faster.

        Can too much RAM slow down your computer?
        Anything the processor is working from will be transferred from RAM into the Processor cache, regardless of where it is located in RAM and access time from one portion of RAM to another does nor result in a slowing of the process.

        Does RAM increase FPS?
        In some scenarios and depending on how much RAM you have, yes, adding more RAM could increase your FPS. Games require a certain amount of memory to run. The amount of memory that games require to run can vary from game to game.

        Why adding more RAM can improve the performance of a computer system?
        With more RAM, more of the program instructions can be loaded and there is less need to keep swapping data in and out to the swap file on the hard disk drive. The constant swapping of data slows down the speed at which applications can run, so increasing RAM will increase the speed of operation of the computer.

        Is it better to have more RAM or faster RAM?
        Faster RAM will give your PC better performance in certain specific benchmarks, but in terms of actual benefit to most users, having more RAM available is almost always better than having faster RAM.

        Do more cores make a computer faster?
        A CPU that offers multiple cores may perform significantly better than a single-core CPU of the same speed. Multiple cores allow PCs to run multiple processes at the same time with greater ease, increasing your performance when multitasking or under the demands of powerful apps and programs.

        How does pipelining improve the performance of a computer?
        Pipelining increases the CPU instruction throughput - the number of instructions completed per unit of time. But it does not reduce the execution time of an individual instruction. In fact, it usually slightly increases the execution time of each instruction due to overhead in the pipeline control.

        Why can cache improve performance?
        Cache is a small amount of memory which is part of the CPU which is physically closer to the CPU than RAM is. This reduces the need for frequent slower memory retrievals from main memory, which may otherwise keep the CPU waiting. 

        How do I choose a graphics card for my computer?
        Bottom line: You need to make sure your graphics card will fit in your PC, that it supports your desired video connector, and that your PSU is sufficient, preferably before the purchase. Or if you're building a new PC, make sure your case can fit your graphics card and buy a 500W or larger PSU.

        What makes the computer powerful?
        The overall speed or clock speed of the computer and how fast it is capable of processing data is managed by the computer processor (CPU). A good processor is capable of executing more instructions every second, hence, increased speed.

        Why is Cache memory faster than RAM?
        Cache is faster than RAM for a number of reasons: It is close to the CPU. The address from a register must travel a very short distance to reach the cache - typically one clock cycle - and the data has only about one cycle to return to the CPU.

        Does dual OS slow computer?
        No, dual booting won't slow your computer at all. Here's the reason: Only one operating system loads into memory at a time. The others will be idle in your hard disk. So, your RAM and processor are completely dedicated to run that OS.

        Where is the CPU/processor located?
        The central processing unit (CPU), also called a processor, is located inside the computer case on the motherboard. It is sometimes called the brain of the computer, and its job is to carry out commands.

        Why is the laptop so slow?
        A slow computer is often caused by too many programs running simultaneously, taking up processing power and reducing the PC's performance. Some programs will continue running in the background even after you have closed them or will start automatically when you boot up your computer.

        What is a good processor speed for laptop?
        A good processor speed is between 3.50 to 4.2 GHz, but it is more important to have a single-thread performance. In short, 3.5 to 4.2 GHz is a good speed for processor.

        2. A system has one CPU and one disk drive. It processes transactions that require 100 ms of CPU time and 25 disk accesses per transaction. Assuming that a disk access takes 10 ms:
        a) What is the maximum system throughput? 
        Ans  4 transactions/s 
        Explanation: Since each transaction requires 100 ms of CPU time and 25×10 ms of disk time, the disk is the bottleneck.
        b) What is the maximum CPU utilization? 
        Ans: 40% 
        Explanation: When the disk is utilized at 100%, the CU will work 100/250 of time. 
        c) What is the maximum disk utilization? 
        Ans: 100% 
        Explanation: Since the disk is the bottleneck, its utilization can go up to 100% 


        <b>SUMMARISATION</b>
        Assume you have obtained a large set of results for the value of a performance metric. This can be fully described by the distribution of the data, and illustrated by a histogram. The histogram displays on the y-axis the ratio of data that fall in the bin on the x-axis. Summarizing means compressing it into one or a few numbers that represent both its average and variability. In practice of communication and information systems, this is done by either one of the following two: 
        a) Median and Quantile:- A median is a value that falls in the middle of the distribution, i.e. 50% of the data is below and 50% above. A p%-quantile leaves p% of the observation below and 100 − p% above. The median gives some information about the average, while extreme quantiles give information about the dispersion. A commonly used plot is the Box Plot. It shows the median, the 25% and 75% quantiles (called “quartiles”) and the “outliers”, defined as data points that are a fixed fraction away from the quartiles. It also shows variability by the following heuristic. It plots a line that extends to the most extreme value up to 1.5 times the inter-quartile distance.

        b) Mean and Standard Deviation:- The mean m of a data set x1, ..., xn is m = 1 n n i=1 xi. It gives some information about the average. The standard deviation s of a data set is defined by s2 = 1 n n i=1 (xi − m) 2 or s2 = 1 n−1 n i=1 (xi − m) 2 (either conventions are used). It gives information about the variability. The use of standard deviation is rooted in the belief that data roughly follows a normal distribution, with some mean μ and some variance σ2. The normal distribution is characterized by histogram with Bell shape. It is very frequently encountered because of the central limit theorem that says that an average of many things tends to be normal though, there are some exceptions. If such a hypothesis is true, and if we had m ≈ μ and σ ≈ s, then with 95% probability, the data sample would lie in the interval m ± 1.96s. This justifies the use of mean-variance plots that use as a measure of variability the interval m ± 1.96s. This is also called a prediction interval since it predicts a likely range for a future sample.
